## Introduction

Hi! I am Dimitri 👋, the current maintainer of the
[GraphQL-ESLint](https://github.com/dimaMachina/graphql-eslint) linter, and today I want to share with you
all changes that were made in the last version. This is a small minor version update, but a bunch of
new rules and options were added.

<Callout>
  If you are not familiar with GraphQL-ESLint check out [here](/blog/introducing-graphql-eslint) an
  introduction blog post by GraphQL-ESLint creator [Dotan Simha](https://github.com/dotansimha).

## Support New ESLint Flat Config System

> Say Hello to the new flat config system!

GraphQL-ESLint v3.14 fully supports
[the new ESLint flat config system](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/new-config-system-part-2),
[most of the examples](https://github.com/dimaMachina/graphql-eslint/tree/master/examples) were updated to
show you how you will set it up in the newly `eslint.config.js` file in the following years!

## ESLint Suggestions for `graphql-js` Rules

All `graphql-js` rules that contain "Did you mean" suggestions now can be fixable via ESLint
suggestions API in your editor 🎉.

## Update of `graphql-config`

GraphQL-ESLint comes with a new GraphQL Config v4.4 that no longer requires a `typescript`
dependency to be installed.

<Callout>
  Also, GraphQL Config is no longer bundled with `cosmiconfig-toml-loader` and
  `cosmiconfig-typescript-loader`. You must install it manually in case of using TOML or TypeScript
  config. The benefit of this is that bundle size is reduced by 35%.
</Callout>

## New Rules

The new version introduces 4 new rules:

### Rule `require-nullable-fields-with-oneof`

Require `input` or `type` fields to be non-nullable with `@oneOf` directive

```json filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "rules": {
    "@graphql-eslint/require-nullable-fields-with-oneof": "error"
  }
}
```

<Comparison>
```graphql filename="❌ Incorrect"
input Input @oneOf {
  foo: String!
  bar: [Int!]!
}
```
```graphql filename="✅ Correct"
input Input @oneOf {
  foo: String
  bar: [Int!]
}
```
</Comparison>

### Rule `require-type-pattern-with-oneof`

Enforce types with `@oneOf` directive have `error` and `ok` fields.

- It's easier to communicate user errors in the response
- Errors can contain any additional info the client might need (error code, validation info and so
  on)
- Reduce the need to use `... on Error` and so on, no need to specify type names in the query

```json filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "rules": {
    "@graphql-eslint/require-type-pattern-with-oneof": "error"
  }
}
```

<Comparison>
```graphql filename="❌ Incorrect"
type DoSomethingMutationResult @oneOf {
  notok: DoSomethingSuccess
  noterror: Error
}
```
```graphql filename="✅ Correct"
type DoSomethingMutationResult @oneOf {
  ok: DoSomethingSuccess
  error: Error
}
```
</Comparison>

### Rule `lone-executable-definition`

Require queries, mutations, subscriptions or fragments to be located in separate files.

```json filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "rules": {
    "@graphql-eslint/lone-executable-definition": "error"
  }
}
```

<Comparison>
```graphql filename="❌ Incorrect"
# users.graphql
query Users {
  users {
    ...UserFields
  }
}
fragment UserFields on User {
  id
}
```
```graphql filename="✅ Correct"
# users.graphql
query Users {
  users {
    ...UserFields
  }
}
```
</Comparison>

### Rule `no-one-place-fragments`

An original proposal for a rule to suggest inline fragments that are spread only in one place was
asked [2 years ago](https://github.com/dimaMachina/graphql-eslint/issues/72#issue-715054179) and finally,
this rule is a part of GraphQL-ESLint.

```json filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "rules": {
    "@graphql-eslint/no-one-place-fragments": "error"
  }
}
```

<Comparison>
```graphql filename="❌ Incorrect"
fragment UserFields on User {
  id
}

{
  user {
    ...UserFields
  }
}
```
```graphql filename="✅ Correct"
{
  user {
    ...UserFields
    friends {
      ...UserFields
    }
  }
}
```
</Comparison>

## New Options

### `groups` Option for `alphabetize` Rule

`alphabetize` rule is one of the powerful GraphQL-ESLint rules, that can sort all the things in your
GraphQL, it also supports ESLint suggestions fixes.

Unfortunately, before it was not possible to configure to put some properties at the start or at the
end, but now it was fixed with new option `groups`.

Here is an example of configuration and cases:

```json filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "rules": {
    "@graphql-eslint/alphabetize": [
      "error",
      {
        "fields": ["ObjectTypeDefinition"],
        "groups": ["id", "*", "createdAt", "updatedAt"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning">`*` symbol is mandatory, which means everything else.</Callout>

<Comparison>
```graphql filename="❌ Incorrect"
type User {
  createdAt: DateTime!
  email: Email!
  firstName: String!
  id: ID!
  lastName: String!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```
```graphql filename="✅ Correct"
type User {
  id: ID!
  email: Email!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```
</Comparison>

### `rootField` Option for `require-description` Rule

This option enforces each field of root type (`Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription`) to have a
description.

```json filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "rules": {
    "@graphql-eslint/require-description": ["error", { "rootField": true }]
  }
}
```

<Comparison>
```graphql filename="❌ Incorrect"
type Mutation {
  createUser: User
}

type User {
  name: String
}
```
```graphql filename="✅ Correct"
type Mutation {
  "Create a new user"
  createUser: User
}

type User {
  name: String
}
```
</Comparison>

### `prefix` Option for `match-document-filename` Rule

Previously in this rule, we had only a `suffix` option but in our open-source SAAS project
[Hive](/graphql/hive), we prefix all files with executable definitions with
[their operation types](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/tree/main/packages/web/app/src/graphql).

Now, everybody can take benefit from this new option 🎉.

```json filename=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "rules": {
    "@graphql-eslint/match-document-filename": [
      "error",
      {
        "mutation": {
          "style": "kebab-case",
          "prefix": "mutation."
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<Comparison>
```graphql filename="❌ Incorrect"
# createUser.graphql

mutation CreateUser {
  # ...
}
```
```graphql filename="✅ Correct"
# mutation.create-user.graphql

mutation CreateUser {
  # ...
}
```
</Comparison>
