with `<Callout>` component for `.md`/`.mdx` files.

If you want to benefit this feature with your own theme and your own `<Callout>` component:

<Steps>

<h4>Create a `<Blockquote>` Component</h4>

To create a `<Blockquote>` component, start by importing `withGitHubAlert` from `nextra/components`.
You should then create the `<Blockquote>` component by invoking the `withGitHubAlert` function.

The first argument should be a React HOC component that handles the GitHub alert syntax, and the
second argument should be your standard `<blockquote>` component.

The `type` prop can be one of the following:
`'note' | 'tip' | 'important' | 'warning' | 'caution'{:ts}`.

```jsx
import { withGitHubAlert } from 'nextra/components'

const Blockquote = withGitHubAlert(({ type, ...props }) => {
  return <MyCalloutComponent type={type} {...props} />
}, MyBlockquoteComponent)
```

<h4>Provide `<Blockquote>` to `useMDXComponents`</h4>

To make the `<Blockquote>` component available, you should integrate it into the `useMDXComponents`
function:

```jsx filename="mdx-components.jsx"
export function useMDXComponents(components) {
  return {
    blockquote: Blockquote,
    ...components
  }
}
```

</Steps>
