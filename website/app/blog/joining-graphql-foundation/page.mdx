We are happy to announce that The Guild has joined the GraphQL Foundation as an official member!

We are happy to join companies like Facebook, Twitter, AWS, Shopify, Apollo and
[others](https://foundation.graphql.org/members) in order to help shape the future of GraphQL and
the community.

It is not cheap to be a foundation member, but we feel there is a big need and that we have a lot to
contribute for that important goal.

We feel that because of our [unique structure](/about-us), we can contribute in unique ways to the
foundation.

We want to open the core foundation work for the community, making it easier for all of you to
contribute and influence GraphQL's future.

Here are the first things we are going to focus on, and we would love your help with them:

### 1. [GraphQL.org](https://graphql.org)

graphql.org is a very important website. It is important because it's the first thing beginners
would get to when starting with GraphQL. Making that first experience smooth and easy is crucial.

The graphql.org website is very good, but it hasn't been updated for a couple of years now since the
original creators finished with their current iteration.

There are no active maintainers and contributions are being completely blocked.

That leads to people getting stuck and following the resources and links into unmaintained tutorials
and libraries.

We've decided to invest time and improve the website as much as we can!

[Dipesh Wagle](https://github.com/Dipeshwagle) lead and [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)
joined him and both have did some awesome work! Check out their PRs on the website, follow the
discussions, let us know for any feedback or improvements you have and we would love your help if
you want to contribute!

1. [Upgrading graphql.org to Gatsby](https://github.com/graphql/graphql.github.io/pull/938)
2. [Improving graphql.org code's page](https://github.com/graphql/graphql.github.io/pull/936)

### 2. [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)

graphql-js is a powerful library that is engine behind many community libraries today.

Ever since it was originally created by Lee Byron, which has done an amazing work creating a library
that is still so powerful and relevant, not a lot of major changes has happened.

That is a good thing, but with time came more needs for updates and improvements.

The current biggest improvement that is waiting is the TypeScript migration. It has been planned for
a couple of years now but not a lot of progress has been made.

We are going to change that now. Please follow the issue, read throughout the discussion to see what
was planned and what happened, and help us unlock the work and make real progress towards a full
migration.

### [Roadmap to TypeScript Issue](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/2104)

This also holds back many other things like the great work that has been done on
[stream and defer](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/2319) (the current plan is to merge
that into master only after that TS migration has been done).

We are actively working on it and now is the perfect time to join and help us with that effort.
Reach out and let us know if you can help and how we could support you with anything you need.

Also, please join the new
[graphql-js working group sessions](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js-wg).

### 3. Community Forum

Today the GraphQL community is scattered across many different forums. That's ok, but having a
central place to talk about common issues can be good, because it means you won't have to lock
yourself into specific solutions in order to solve common problems. We believe there is importance
of talking about shared best practices, no matter what tools and languages you use.

We also are to blame for that as we've created our own Discord channel. The reason is that the
official GraphQL Slack wasn't being promoted and that the history of the messages there was being
deleted.

We want to merge our own popular forum into the official GraphQL forum and revive the discussions
there and hope others would follow. For that we need to decide on the right solution. Please
[follow the relevant issue](https://github.com/graphql/foundation/issues/21) and share your
thgouhts.

### 4. GraphQL's General Growth in the Community

Everyone here is working on GraphQL because we think it's a good idea :)

So we would love to see GraphQL grow and spread.

Currently, the foundation hasn't been doing a lot of promotion and using it's assets like that
website, social accounts and things like that. One thing we believe could be valuable is a monthly
newsletter from the foundation. But instead of inventing a new one, we thought it was a better idea
to collaborate with the existing ones.

So we've reached out to Prisma, which owns the GraphQL Weekly newsletter and has been maintaining it
for years and decided to partner with them to spread the fondation's messages!

# Summary

Our goals are to help open the doors for anyone who wants to be part of the community, learn and
contribute!

Everything we wrote above is just the start, and we want to hear from you how we could improve the
GraphQL community as a whole.

We hope that our work would help you acheive that, but we mostly want to hear from you - what are
the things that stop you from contributing and influencing the community? Let us know and let's
change that together!
