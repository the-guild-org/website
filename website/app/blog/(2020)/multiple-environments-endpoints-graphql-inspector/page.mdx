One of the features introduced with the new version of GraphQL Inspector is a support for **multiple
variants of GraphQL schema** and ability to use **live and running GraphQL endpoints**.

We recently released a lot more interesting features. You can read about them in
["New GraphQL Inspector and upcoming features"](/blog/new-graphql-inspector) article.

Here, we're going to focus on environments and endpoints only.

## Using Environments

The previous iteration of GraphQL Inspector worked with only a single target branch. Every Pull
Request was checked against the default branch of Git repository. We can agree, it's not ideal :)

**The new version allows to define as many environments as you wish**. We called them "environments"
but those are just variants of GraphQL schema. You may have production environment as well as
staging and QA.

**Using multiple environments means:**

- notifications narrowed down to each variant of schema
- ability to define different settings per environment

Follow the [_"Using Environments"_](https://graphql-inspector.com/docs/recipes/environments) chapter
in our docs.

## Using Endpoints

We highly recommend to use branches to identify environments but GraphQL Inspector is here to help
and not force any opinionated patterns.

That's why the new version introduces a way to **use live and running GraphQL endpoints as the
source of truth of schema**.

This approach is very useful when you don't deploy an API on every Push and your default branch is
fine with temporary breaking changes. To learn more, read
[_"Using Endpoints"_ chapter](https://graphql-inspector.com/docs/recipes/endpoints).

## Future Plans

We're working on **Azure and Bitbucket integrations** plus a **monitoring feature**. Talk to us to
try it out.

We want to make **Azure** and **Bitbucket** a first-class citizens in GraphQL Inspector and give you
the same experience as you get right now with **GitHub**.

**Monitoring** will enable you to analyze the traffic of your GraphQL APIs and provide details
needed to improve performance. Collecting information about the usage will let you safely remove
deprecated pieces of GraphQL Schema.

We have big plans for Inspector, and you're very welcome to join us in that journey.

GraphQL Inspector is a tool created by developers, for developers and that's why we'd love to get
your feedback and shape GraphQL Inspector together!
