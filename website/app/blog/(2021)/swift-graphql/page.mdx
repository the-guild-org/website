I love Swift, you love Swift, we want to do everything we can in Swift. It has a fantastic
type-system and a robust compiler. We also like GraphQL. It's a neat way to construct a type-safe
bridge from your server to the client. Its syntax isn't as rich as Swift's, but who cares, right?
[SwiftGraphQL](https://swift-graphql.com) aims to make the best of both worlds, here's how we do it.

I started working on [SwiftGraphQL](https://swift-graphql.com) because no other client sufficed my
needs for building iOS applications.

## Goals

Firstly, I wanted to keep the application's state separated from the GraphQL schema. Keeping it
separate has a couple of benefits: We don't have to turn the whole application upside down whenever
a field name or a type changes in the schema. That might happen if you generate types right from the
queries and reuse the same query in multiple places. Swift's type-system is richer than GraphQL's.
By separating the state from the schema, we can implement enum types with parameters, create new
structures and nest them. We can add logic to the model and verify the data when converting query
results to the state. We can implement structures that represent custom scalar types and treat them
as first-person citizens in our codebase.

Secondly, my apps usually consist of hundreds of types. I want my client to scale as my app scales,
meaning it should be as easy to handle hundred schema types as ten. Additionally, I want to use
everything that Swift's ecosystem offers without my client restricting me.

Lastly, there are nuances in my queries that I want to modify using code. Ideally, I want to
dynamically generate my queries and still get the type-safety that GraphQL promises. This way, I can
write recursive queries and fine-tune return types for specific use cases.

To sum it up, I wanted a flexible, scalable and robust GraphQL client.

## Checking Out Existing Solutions

With goals in mind, I started considering existing GraphQL clients.

[Graphaello](https://graphaello.dev) seemed like a viable option; it is type-safe, I can
programmatically make selections, and it looks like it could scale well. However, Graphaello tightly
binds me to my schema, and I can only use structures to represent my data.

[Apollo iOS](https://apollographql.com/docs/ios), on the other hand, generates Swift types from
queries in our "queries.graphql" files and supports caching out of the box. Generating types from
the SDL is not per se a problem, but it becomes cumbersome and error-prone with large nested
queries. Apollo iOS also strongly-binds the generated structures to your queries, making it almost
impossible to translate fetched data into an internal state.

## SwiftGraphQL

Now, let's turn to [SwiftGraphQL](https://swift-graphql.com). Consider a typical StarWars API
example with the following schema.

```graphql
type Query {
  humans: [Human!]!
}

type Human {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  home: String
}
```

I will show a trivial example, but with [SwiftGraphQL](https://swift-graphql.com), you'll handle
even more complex scenarios just as easily. We want to separate our model from the schema; that's
why we create a Person type.

```swift
struct Person {
  var id: String
  var name: String
}
```

To make a selection, we use `Selection.` followed by the name of the type that we want to use to
make a selection. In our case, that would be `Selection.Human`.

```swift
let human = Selection.Human {
  Person(
    id: try $0.id(),
    name: try $0.name()
  )
}
```

There's a great deal more happening behind the scenes to make sure you only select fields in the
schema, but for now, let's remember that we make a selection this way.

Once you have your types covered, you can construct and perform a query using the `send` method.

```swift
let query = Selection.Query {
    $0.human(id: "1000", selection: human)
}

send(query, to: "https://swapi.graphql.com") { result in
    if let data = try? result.get() {
        print(data.human)
    }
}
```

Easy, right?

## Final Words

The example above only scratched the surface of what is possible with
[SwiftGraphQL](https://swift-graphql.com). To sum it up, [SwiftGraphQL](https://swift-graphql.com)
is a code generator and a lightweight GraphQL client. It comes with a set of neat features like

- You only have to generate code once (i.e. every time your schema changes),
- It ensures that every query you can send is valid,
- You can write queries programmatically,
- It supports queries, mutations as well as subscriptions.

And the best part? It's super easy to get started.

1. Install the generator using `brew install swift-graphql`,
1. Generate the API by running `swift-graphql <endpoint> --output ./file.swift`,
1. Start querying your data.

[SwiftGraphQL](https://swift-graphql.com) is a young, slowly evolving library. I want to make it the
best Swift GraphQL client; that's why I'd love to hear how you use it. To support its development,
make sure you leave a star on GitHub and connect with me on Twitter. And if you are actively using
it, consider becoming my sponsor on GitHub.

[SwiftGraphQL](https://swift-graphql.com) works under the hood. Make sure to subscribe to our
