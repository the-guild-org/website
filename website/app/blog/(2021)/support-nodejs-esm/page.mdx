**ECMAScript modules**, also known as **ESM**, is the
[official standard format](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-modules) to package JavaScript, and
fortunately [Node.js supports it](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_modules_ecmascript_modules)
üéâ.

But if you have been in the Node.js Ecosystem for some time and developing libraries, you have
probably encountered the fact that ESM compatibility has been a struggle, behind experimental flags
and/or broken for practical usage.

Very few libraries actually supported it officially, but since Node.js **v12.20.0** (2020-11-24) and
**v14.13.0** (2020-09-29) the latest and finally stable version of `package.exports` is available,
and since support for Node.js v10.x is dropped, everything should be fine and supporting ESM
shouldn't be that hard.

After working on migrating all **The Guild** libraries, for example
[GraphQL Code Generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/pull/6102) or the
recently released [Envelop](https://github.com/dotansimha/envelop/pull/259), and contributing in
other important libraries in the ecosystem, like
[graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3217), I felt like sharing this experience
is really valuable, and the current state of ESM in the Node.js Ecosystem as a whole needs some
extra care from everyone.

This post is intended to work as a guide to support both CommonJS **and** ESM and will be updated
accordingly in the future as needed, and one key feature to be able to make this happens, is the
`package.json` `exports` field.

## `exports` Field

The official Node.js documentation about it is available
[here](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_exports), but the most interesting section is
[Conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_conditional_exports), which
enables libraries to support both CommonJS and ESM:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "name": "foo",
  "exports": {
    "require": "./main.js",
    "import": "./main.mjs"
  }
}
```

This field basically tells Node.js what file to use when importing/requiring the package.

But very often you will encounter the situation that a library can (and should, in my opinion) ship
the library keeping their file structure, which allows for the library user to import/require only
the modules they need for their application, or simply for the fact that a library can have more
than a single entry-point.

For the reason just mentioned, the standard `package.json#exports` should look something like this
(even for single entry-point libraries, it won't hurt in any way):

> Assuming that the build/compilation/transpilation is outputted into the "dist" folder

```jsonc
{
  // package.json
  "name": "foo",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "require": "./dist/index.js",
      "import": "./dist/index.mjs"
    },
    "./*": {
      "require": "./dist/*.js",
      "import": "./dist/*.mjs"
    }
  }
}
```

To specify specific paths for deep imports, you can specify them:

```jsonc
{
  "exports": {
    // ...
    "./utils": {
      "require": "./dist/utils.js",
      "import": "./dist/utils.mjs"
    }
  }
}
```

If you don't want to break backward compatibility on import/require with the explicit `.js`, the
solution is to add the extension in the export:

```jsonc
{
  "exports": {
    // ...
    "./utils": {
      "require": "./dist/utils.js",
      "import": "./dist/utils.mjs"
    },
    "./utils.js": {
      "require": "./dist/utils.js",
      "import": "./dist/utils.mjs"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using the `.mjs` Extension

To add support ESM for Node.js, you have two alternatives:

1. build your library into [ESM Compatible](#esm-compatible) modules with the extension `.mjs`, and
   keep the CommonJS version with the standard `.js` extension
2. build your library into [ESM Compatible](#esm-compatible) modules with the extension `.js`, set
   `"type": "module"`, and the CommonJS version of your modules with the `.cjs` extension.

Clearly using the `.mjs` extension is the cleaner solution, and everything should work just fine.

## ESM Compatible

This section assumes that your library is written in TypeScript or has at least has a transpilation
process, if your library is targeting the browser and/or React.js, it most likely already does.

Building for a library to be compatible with ESM might not be as straight-forward as we would like,
and it's for the simple fact that in the pure ESM world, `require` doesn't exists, as simple as
that, **You will need to refactor any `require` into `import`**.

### Changing `require`

If you have a top-level `require`, changing it to ESM should be straight-forward:

> from

```js
const foo = require('foo')
```

> to

```js
import foo from 'foo'
```

But if you are dynamically calling require inside of functions, you will need to do some refactoring
to be able to handle async imports:

> from

```js
function getFoo() {
  const { bar } = require('foo')

  return bar
}
```

> to

```js
async function getFoo() {
  const { bar } = await import('foo')

  return bar
}
```

#### What about `__dirname`, `require.resolve`, `require.cache`?

This is when it gets complicated,
[citing the Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_differences_between_es_modules_and_commonjs):

- ![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1625694693887/reb3raKCA.png)

This is kinda obvious, you should use `import` and `export`

- ![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1625694836704/ON-ICGMTa.png)

The only workaround to have an isomorphic `__dirname` or `__filename` to be used for both "cjs" and
"esm" without using build-time tools like
[@rollup/plugin-replace](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/replace) or
[esbuild "define"](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#define) would be using a library like
[filedirname](https://npmjs.com/package/filedirname) that does a trick inspecting error stacks, it's
clearly not the cleanest solution.

The workaround alongside with `createRequire` should like this

```ts
import { createRequire } from 'node:module'
import filedirname from 'filedirname'

const [filename] = filedirname()

const require_isomorphic = createRequire(filename)

require_isomorphic('foo')
```

- ![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1625698233060/vHvCI9hH6.png)

`require.resolve` and `require.cache` are not available in the ESM world, and if you are not able to
do the refactor to not use them, you could use
[createRequire](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#module_module_createrequire_filename), but keep
in mind that the cache and file resolution is not the same as while using `import` in ESM.

### Deep Import of `node_modules` Packages

Part of the ESM Specification is that you have to specify the extension in explicit scripts imports,
which means when you are importing a specific JavaScript file from a node_modules package you have
to specify the `.js` extension, otherwise all the users will get
`Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module`

This **won't work** in ESM

```ts
import { foo } from 'foo/lib/main'
```

But this will

```ts
import { foo } from 'foo/lib/main.js'
```

**BUT** there is a **big exception** to this, which is the node_modules package you are importing
uses the [`exports`](#exports) `package.json` field, because generally the `exports` field will have
to extension in the alias itself, and if you specify the extension on those packages, it will result
in a double extension:

```json filename="bar/package.json"
{
  "name": "bar",
  "exports": {
    "./*": {
      "require": "./dist/*.js",
      "import": "./dist/*.mjs"
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
import { bar } from 'bar/main.js'
```

That will translate into `node_modules/bar/main.js.js` in CommonJS and
`node_modules/bar/main.js.mjs` in ESM.

### Can We Test If Everything Is Actually ESM Compatible?

The best solution for this is to have ESM examples in a monorepo testing firsthand if everything
with the logic included doesn't break, using tools that output both CommonJS & ESM like
[tsup](https://tsup.egoist.sh) might become very handy, but that might not be straightforward,
especially for big projects.

There is a relatively small but effective way of automated testing for all the top-level imports in
ESM, you can have an ESM script that imports every `.mjs` file of your project, it will quickly
scan, importing everything, and if nothing breaks, you are good to go üëç, here is a small example of
a script that does this, and it's currently used in some projects that support ESM
https://gist.github.com/PabloSzx/6f9a34a677e27d2ee3e4826d02490083.

## TypeScript

In regard to TypeScript supporting ESM, it divides into two subjects:

### Support for `exports`

Until this issue [TypeScript#33069](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33079) is closed,
TypeScript doesn't have complete support for it, fortunately, there are 2 workarounds:

- Using `typesVersions`

The original usage for this TypeScript feature
[was not for this purpose](https://typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html#version-selection-with-typesversions),
but it works, and it's a fine workaround until TypeScript actually supports it

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "typesVersions": {
    "*": {
      "dist/index.d.ts": ["dist/index.d.ts"],
      "*": ["dist/*", "dist/*/index.d.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Publishing a modified version of the package

This method requires tooling and/or support from the package manager. For example, using the
package.json field `publishConfig.directory`,
[pnpm supports it](https://pnpm.io/package_json#publishconfigdirectory) and
[lerna publish as well](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/publish#publishconfigdirectory).
This allows you to publish a modified version of the package that can contain a modified version of
the `exports`, following the types with the file structure in the root, and TypeScript will
understand it without needing to specify anything special in the package.json for it to work.

```json filename="dist/package.json"
{
  "exports": {
    "./*": {
      "require": "./*.js",
      "import": "./*.mjs"
    },
    ".": {
      "require": "./index.js",
      "import": "./index.mjs"
    }
  }
}
```

> In [The Guild](/) we use this method using tooling that creates the temporary package.json
> automatically. See [bob-the-bundler](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/bob) &
> [bob-esbuild](https://github.com/PabloSzx/bob-esbuild)

### Support for `.mjs` Output

Currently, the TypeScript compiler can't output `.mjs`, Check the issue
[TypeScript#18442](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/18442).

There are workarounds, but nothing actually works in 100% of the possible use-cases (see for
example, [ts-jest issue](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/issues/1057)), and for that reason,
we recommend tooling that enables this type of building without needing any workaround, usually
using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) and/or [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io).

## ESM Needs Our Attention

There are still some rough edges while supporting ESM, this guide shows only some of them, but now
it's time to rip the bandaid off.

I can mention a very famous contributor of the Node.js Ecosystem
[sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) who has a very strong stance in ESM. His Blog post
[`Get Ready For ESM`](https://blog.sindresorhus.com/get-ready-for-esm-aa53530b3f77) and a
[very common GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)
nowadays in a lot of very important libraries he maintains.

But personally, I don't think only supporting ESM and killing CommonJS should be the norm, both
standards can live together, there is already a big ecosystem behind CommonJS, and we shouldn't
ignore it.
