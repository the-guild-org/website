On a high-level, GraphQL servers are pretty easy to set up. Just passing a GraphQL schema and
starting the server does the job.

However, for many use-cases, such a setup might not be sufficient.

Let's dive into each of the phases of a GraphQL request and learn how enhancing each phase can help
to set up a production ready GraphQL server.

Note: While GraphQL can be done over almost any protocol, this article focuses on the most commonly
used protocol [GraphQL over HTTP](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http). However, most
knowledge can be transferred to other protocols such as GraphQL over WebSockets or other more exotic
ones.

![The Phases of an GraphQL Request](/blog-assets/the-anatomy-of-a-graphql-request/phases-breakdown.png)

## HTTP Parsing and Normalization

Clients send HTTP requests to the server with a payload that contains an operation document string
(query, mutation, or subscription), optionally some variables, and the operation name from the
document that shall be executed.

When the requests are executed via the POST HTTP method, the body will be a JSON object:

**Example JSON POST Body**

```json
{
  "query": "query UserById($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { id name } }",
  "variables": { "id": "10" },
  "operationName": "UserById"
}
```

However, when using the GET HTTP method (e.g. for query operations) those parameters can also be
provided as a query search string. The values are then URL-encoded.

**Example GET URL**

```
http://localhost:8080/graphql?query=query%20UserById%28%24id%3A%20ID%21%29%20%7B%20user%28id%3A%20%24id%29%20%7B%20id%20name%20%7D%20%7D&variables=%7B%20%22id%22%3A%20%2210%22%20%7DoperationName=UserById
```

The GraphQL HTTP server's first task is to parse and normalize the body or query string and
furthermore determine the protocol that shall be used for sending the response. The protocols can
be:

- `application/graphql+json` (or `application/json` for legacy clients) for a single result that
  yields from the execution phase
- `multipart/mixed` for incremental delivery (when using `@defer` and `@stream` directives).

Not officially in the specification, but also used is `text/event-stream` for event streams (e.g.
when executing subscription or live query operations).

## GraphQL Parse

After parsing and normalizing the request, the server will pass on the GraphQL parameters onto the
GraphQL engine that will parse the GraphQL operation document (which can contain any number of
query, mutation, or subscription operations and fragment definitions).

If there is any typo or syntax error, this phase will yield GraphQLErrors for each of those issues
and pass them back to the server layer to send those back to the client.

For the following invalid GraphQL operation (`)` missing after `$id` at line 2):

```
query UserById($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

The error will look similar to this:

```json
{
  "message": "Syntax Error: Expected Name, found {",
  "locations": [
    {
      "line": 2,
      "column": 16
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the error messages are unfortunately not always straightforward and helpful. The
location can, however, help you track down the syntax error!

In case no error occurs, the parse phase produces an AST (abstract syntax tree).

The AST is a handy format that is used for the follow-up phases `validate` and `execute`.

For our operation it would be identical to the following JSON:

```json
{
  "kind": "Document",
  "definitions": [
    {
      "kind": "OperationDefinition",
      "operation": "query",
      "name": {
        "kind": "Name",
        "value": "UserById"
      },
      "variableDefinitions": [
        {
          "kind": "VariableDefinition",
          "variable": {
            "kind": "Variable",
            "name": {
              "kind": "Name",
              "value": "id"
            }
          },
          "type": {
            "kind": "NonNullType",
            "type": {
              "kind": "NamedType",
              "name": {
                "kind": "Name",
                "value": "ID"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "selectionSet": {
        "kind": "SelectionSet",
        "selections": [
          {
            "kind": "Field",
            "name": {
              "kind": "Name",
              "value": "user"
            },
            "arguments": [
              {
                "kind": "Argument",
                "name": {
                  "kind": "Name",
                  "value": "id"
                },
                "value": {
                  "kind": "Variable",
                  "name": {
                    "kind": "Name",
                    "value": "id"
                  }
                }
              }
            ],
            "selectionSet": {
              "kind": "SelectionSet",
              "selections": [
                {
                  "kind": "Field",
                  "name": {
                    "kind": "Name",
                    "value": "id"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "kind": "Field",
                  "name": {
                    "kind": "Name",
                    "value": "name"
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This procedure is performed by the `parse` function that is exported from `graphql-js`. Other
languages that are orientate themselves on the `graphql-js` reference implementation have a
corresponding counterpart.

## GraphQL Validate

In the validation phase, the parsed document is validated against our GraphQL schema to ensure all
selected fields in the operation are available and valid. The previously parsed AST makes it easier
for the validation rules to have a common interface of traversing the document. Furthermore, other
validation rules that ensure that the document follows the GraphQL specification are checked, E.g.
whether variables referenced in the document are declared in the operation definition.

As an example the following operation is missing a definition for the `$id` variable:

```graphql
query UserById {
  user(id: $id) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

If the AST of that operation would be validated the following error will be raised.

```json
[
  {
    "message": "Variable \"$id\" is not defined by operation \"UserById\".",
    "locations": [
      {
        "line": 2,
        "column": 12
      },
      {
        "line": 1,
        "column": 1
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

In case any error is raised the errors are forwarded to the HTTP layer which takes care of sending
them back to the client over the determined protocol. Otherwise, if no errors are raised the
`execution` phase will be performed next.

This procedure is performed by the `validate` function that is exported from `graphql-js`. Other
languages that are orientate themselves on the `graphql-js` reference implementation have a
corresponding counterpart.

## GraphQL Execute

In the execution phase we are actually resolving the data requested by the client using the parsed
and validated GraphQL operation document AST and our GraphQL schema, which contains the resolvers
that specify from where the data the client requests is retrieved.

Previously, the HTTP request has been parsed and normalized, which yielded the following additional
(but optional) values: `variables` and `operationName`.

If the GraphQL document used for execution included more than one executable mutation, query or
subscription operation, the `operationName` is determined to identify the document that shall be
used. If the determined executable operation has any variable definitions, those are asserted
against the `variables` values parsed from the HTTP request.

If anything goes wrong or is incorrect an error is raised. E.g. the variables provided are invalid
or the operation that shall be executed cannot be determined as the `operationName` is invalid or
missing.

**Example error for anonymous document alongside named document**

```graphql
query UserById($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    id
    name
  }
}
query {
  __typename
}
```

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "This anonymous operation must be the only defined operation.",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 7,
          "column": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Such an error will again be forwarded to the client by the HTTP layer.

Otherwise, if no error occurs, the field values will be resolved with all the parsed and provided
parameters. The phase yields a single or stream of GraphQL execution results.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "10",
      "name": "Laurin"
    }
  }
}
```

The HTTP layer forwards those to the client that initiated the request.

This procedure is performed by the `execute` and `subscribe` functions that are exported from
`graphql-js`. Other languages that are orientate themselves on the `graphql-js` reference
implementation have a corresponding counterpart.

# Why Do We Want to Override Different Phases?

## Overriding `parse`

### Add Caching

Parsing a GraphQL document string comes with overhead. We could cache frequently sent document
strings and serve the document from the cache instead of parsing it every single time.

### Test New Functionality

The GraphQL Type system defines the capabilities of the GraphQL service. This phase can be used to
add new capabilities to the type system that may not yet be supported by GraphQL specification.

## Overriding `validate`

### Add Caching

Similar to parsing, validating a GraphQL document AST comes with an overhead. We could cache
recurring document ASTs and server the validation result from the cache instead of validating it
every single time.

### Add Custom Rules

You might want to restrict what kind of operations are allowed to be executed. E.g. If we only want
to allow `query` operations, we can provide a custom validation rule that yields errors as soon as a
`mutation` or `subscription` operation is encountered.

## Overriding `execute` or `subscribe`

### Add Caching

We can serve frequently executed GraphQL operation results from a cache instead of calling all our
resolvers and fetching from a remote database/server every time.

### Add Tracing Information

We can collect statistics by measuring how long it takes to resolve each field in our documents'
selection set and narrow down bottlenecks.

### Mask and Report Errors

We want to make sure the errors occurring during the execution do not contain sensitive information
and are properly reported, so they do not go unnoticed and are properly reported.

### Add New Functionality

We could customize the algorithm that is used by `graphql-js` in order to add new features or make
it more performant e.g. by using [graphql-executor](https://npmjs.com/package/graphql-executor).

## Use Envelop for Extending the Phases

While making our GraphQL servers production ready and working with our clients we discovered that we
were writing the same custom code over and over again.

Envelop provides us a user-friendly way of hooking into the before and after phases of `parse`,
`validate`, `execute` and `subscribe`.

```ts
import { NoSchemaIntrospectionCustomRule } from 'graphql'
import { envelop, Plugin } from '@envelop/core'

const myPlugin: Plugin = {
  onParse() {
    console.log('before parsing')
    return function afterParse({ result }) {
      if (result instanceof Error) {
        console.log('Error occured during parsing: ', result)
      }
    }
  },
  onValidate({ addValidationRule }) {
    // add a custom validation rule
    addValidationRule(NoSchemaIntrospectionCustomRule)

    return function afterValidate({ result }) {
      if (result.length) {
        console.log('Errors occured duting validation: ', result)
      }
    }
  },
  onExecute({ args }) {
    const myVar = args.contextValue.myVar
  }
}

const getEnveloped = envelop({ plugins: [myPlugin] })
const { parse, validate, execute, subscribe } = getEnveloped()
```

Furthermore, the plugins can be easily shared across projects.

## Why Is GraphQL Yoga V2 so Important?

As you might have noticed
[we adopted GraphQL Yoga to The Guild ecosystem quite a while ago](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga/issues/670).
[We have been thinking a lot on how version 2 should look like](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga/issues/704)
and while building and using envelop within our customer projects we realized a few limitations that
can only be solved by owning/wrapping the whole HTTP GraphQL request pipeline.

While envelop is strictly about wrapping the `graphql-js` core functions (`parse`, `validate`,
`execute` and `subscribe`). GraphQL Yoga will provide a unified plugin interface for writing plugins
that hook into ALL of those phases envelop has plus all the encapsulated phases for parsing and
normalizing the HTTP request, allowing you to write powerful GraphQL servers and making features
such as Automatic Persisted Queries or Response Caching more powerful and easy to adopt.

We are excited to announce more details soon.
