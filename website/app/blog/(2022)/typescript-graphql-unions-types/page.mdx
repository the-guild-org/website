## Introduction

The combination of TypeScript and GraphQL can be very powerful. Both TypeScript and GraphQL support
the concept of discriminated unions. In this short blog post, I want to share my last project
experience and share one of the most powerful methods to create stronger types using TypeScript and
GraphQL.

One of my assumptions in this blog post is that you know some TypeScript. If you don't, you can
check out ["Basic Types"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) handbook.
So, let's talk a little bit about TypeScript union types, one of the most remarkable features of
this language.

## What Is a Union Type in TypeScript?

So TypeScript language is based on a type system. TypeScript union operator can be used to define a
variable that can hold multiple data types: integer or number, character, string, float, etc.

Here you can find a basic example:

```ts
let pizzaLover: string | boolean // pizzaLover can be a string or boolean type

pizzaLover = 'YES' // string type
pizzaLover = true // boolean type
```

[Here's a live example in TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/DYUwLgBADglgXnAhgGQPYDcQCcBcEDOYWMAdgOYQA+EARqqqIiQLABQbsCKG2EAvBADkATQCiAZUEQA9NIJFSFMAE8oIDvCRpMWfhCIBXEDLl0GIJvtXrWsiAD0A-GyA)

## How to Use Union Types in TypeScript

TypeScript can also be used to combine complex types such as interfaces. You can think about one
type that contains some others types. Here is a simple example that combines 2 types: `Sushi` and
`Pizza`, both of them can be united into one type by the name `Food`.

```ts
type Sushi = {
  kind: 'Sushi'
  fish: string
  amount: number
}

type Pizza = {
  kind: 'Pizza'
  topping: string
  amount: number
}

type Food = Sushi | Pizza
```

[Here's a live example in TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBAygrgZwBYEsoF4oG8CwAoKKAaxQDsATALigHJ5kUb9CAzFZahYAJzIHNmUAIYBbAPZxSwaqTgiARhG74AvvnyhIUAAooAXnqEZsgkhWo1dBoUwJRgYsGH6ce-QaIlSZcxcrxqeOp4mtAAYmJi5Mb0qFAAPjr6hsFAA)

And another Union type example, this time with `string` and `string`:

```ts
type PizzaAddons = 'olives' | 'mushrooms' | 'pepperoni'

const myPreference: PizzaAddons = 'olives' // ok
const myPreference: PizzaAddons = 'pineapple' // error
```

## GraphQL Union and TypeScript Union Type

GraphQL is a query language that is used to define the API of a server. Like TypeScript or even Go
language, GraphQL supports union and interface types. The type system is one of its core principles
and we can use it to make type-safe API calls. The goal is to use it to propagate our backend types
to the frontend. When I started to learn TypeScript, I found myself making lots of type errors and
annoying misspellings. These errors became more frequent as the project grew. The best solution for
that situation was to add type-safety based on a GraphQL schema.

A GraphQL schema can return one of the multiple object types thanks to the Union or Interface
keywords. Like TypeScript, we can declare which object types are included in the union:

```graphql
union Menu = Pizza | Sushi
```

Let's see a basic example schema that defines a `Menu` union type that can return either a `Pizza`
or `Sushi`:

```graphql
union Menu = Pizza | Sushi

type Pizza {
  title: String!
  topping: String
}

type Sushi {
  name: String!
  fish: String
}

type Query {
  menu: [Menu!]
}
```

After we declare our types in GraphQL and create a union type to return some of the other types, we
can generate TypeScript types from the GraphQL schema and use them in the frontend.

## How to Use GraphQL Codegen to Generate Code and Deal with TypeScript Union Types

First of all, you are more than welcome to explore all the plugins of GraphQL Codegen.
[GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) Like we did in the previous example,
let's talk about getting the data typed safely in the front.

First, let's create our `GetFullMenu` query as follows:

(in this case, I'll use the `react-query` example)

```ts
const menuQuery = gql`
  query GetFullMenu {
    menu {
      ...SomeSushi
      ...SomePizza
    }
  }
  fragment SomeSushi on Sushi {
    name
    fish
  }
  fragment SomePizza on Pizza {
    title
    topping
  }
`
```

Get the `Menu` type from the schema with the query, so we will be able to get the objects inside the
`Menu`.

```ts
const Menu = () => {
  const { data } = useQuery<MenuQuery>('menu', async () => {
    const { menu } = await request(endpoint, menuQuery)
    return menu
  })
}
```

## Conclusion

- I hope this blog post helped you to better understand TypeScript unions and GraphQL unions and the
  way to use them in your project.

- We can create Union and Interface types in both TypeScript and GraphQL, which helps us to better
  define the API of a server and use it in our client.

- A static type check can help safeguard your application. Especially in large-scale applications.

- When you use type-safe GraphQL, it helps you to eliminate existing errors like misspellings and
  errors.

- In this brief blog post, we looked at a few features of TypeScript that help you on code-time,
  most help you to understand the output of any function you create.
