**We are super excited to introduce a new development tool by The Guild!**

While working on very large codebases (hundreds of developers on a single codebase), we've noticed a
gap in the current state-of-the-art development flow for GraphQL developers: it's very hard to
maintain standards in GraphQL schemas and GraphQL operations.

Those could be standards that are specific for a single codebase or shared in the community. As the
GraphQL ecosystem is growing quickly, we decided it's important to create a modern integration
between GraphQL and ESLint, that supports all the modern needs of a GraphQL developer:
[`graphql-eslint`](https://github.com/dimaMachina/graphql-eslint).

> Special thanks to [ilyavolodin](https://github.com/ilyavolodin) for his work on a similar project.
> We've joined forces to bring a new exiting tool for you!

## TL;DR

```
yarn add -D @graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

- [`graphql-eslint` in GitHub](https://github.com/dimaMachina/graphql-eslint)
- [List of available rules](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/eslint/rules) (and
  [planned rules](https://github.com/dimaMachina/graphql-eslint/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anew-rule))

* 🚀 Validates, lints, prettifies and checks for best practices across GraphQL schema and GraphQL
  operations.
* 🚀 Integrates with ESLint core (as a ESTree parser).
* 🚀 Works on `.graphql` files, `gql` usages in code files, and `/* GraphQL */` magic comments.
* 🚀 Lints both GraphQL schema and GraphQL operations.
* 🚀 Extended type-info for more advanced use-cases and sophisticated validations
* 🚀 Supports ESLint directives (for example: `# disable-next-line`)
* 🚀 Easily extendable - supports custom rules based on GraphQL's AST and ESLint API.
* 🚀 Integrates with `graphql-config`
* 🚀 Integrates and visualizes lint issues in popular IDEs (VSCode / WebStorm)

## What It Does?

<Gfycat gifId={'ActualTerrificDog'} />

With `graphql-eslint` you can easily validate and lint your GraphQL schema and your GraphQL
operations, enforce coding-style, best practices, and avoid runtime issues.

It can run as a syntax validation tool (without a GraphQL schema), or as a complete validation
solution for your GraphQL operations (with a schema loaded into it).

`graphql-eslint` works on your `.graphql` files, but also on your code-files that uses `gql`
(graphql template literal tag) or `/* GraphQL */` magic comments.

It is fully integrated with VSCode for visualizing the reported issues, and allows you to customize
the rules, and easily add new custom ones.

## How Does It Work?

This package acts as a ESLint parser, and a plugin with rules.

The parser we wrote transforms the [GraphQL AST](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/language) into
[ESTree structure](https://github.com/estree/estree), so it allows you to travel the GraphQL AST
tree easily.

If you wish to read more about
[how it works, please refer to the docs' directory in the repo](https://github.com/dimaMachina/graphql-eslint/blob/master/docs/README.md).

## Writing Your Own Rules

Since it's running as a real ESLint parser,
[you can easily customize it and write your own rules](https://github.com/dimaMachina/graphql-eslint/blob/master/docs/custom-rules.md),
based on your project's needs and preferences.

If you are familiar with the GraphQL AST structure, you can write custom rules very quickly, since
our solution comes with a wrapper that makes it easier to write and test new rules, and have full
TypeScript support.

Need a new custom rule? Just create a file in your project, and travel the AST to make sure it
matches your needs.

Think that rule might be valuable for others?

```ts
import { GraphQLESLintRule } from '@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin'

const rule: GraphQLESLintRule = {
  create(context) {
    return {
      OperationDefinition(node) {
        if (!node.name || node.name.value === '') {
          context.report({
            node: node,
            message: `Oops, name is required on GraphQL operations!`
          })
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Compared to Similar Tools

There are other solutions that offer GraphQL linting. We decided to write a modern library that fits
our clients' needs, integrates with IDEs and is easily customizable by anyone.

- `apollographql/eslint-plugin-graphql` - offers a similar solution, but is designed in a different
  architecture and unfortunately, it's not customizable and extendable, and doesn't work on some
  modern solution.
- `cjoudrey/graphql-schema-linter` - works as a standalone tool (without ESLint) and offers rules
  for linting GraphQL schemas only.

## Summary

We hope GraphQL-ESLint becomes a central place for the community to collaborate on best practices
and bring them into your team in an automated and easy way.

We already use it in companies like Microsoft on a very large codebases, and it helped us share our
practices across thousands of developers!
