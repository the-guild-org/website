## TL;DR;

- [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/urigo/graphql-cli) is a **popular command-line tool** providing
  various tools for creating and maintaining GraphQL based applications
- [Prisma recently transferred the project to The Guild](https://prisma.io/blog/the-guild-takes-over-oss-libraries-vvluy2i4uevs)
  — and we **completely rewrote** it and closed over 100 issues
- We've already fixed and added many commands, but we are looking to **learn and integrate** with
  tools and companies **across the ecosystem!**
- You can now generate a **full stack working app**, from a GraphQL schema **model**, in **2
  minutes** using the init+generate commands!
- This is an alpha phase — **we want your feedback**, as a user and as a tool creator — Please
  [create an issue](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-cli/issues/new/choose) and
  [join our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/xud7bH9)

## Overview

The GraphQL CLI provides:

- Helpful commands to improve your daily workflows, from starting a project to maintaining it for
  the long run
- Rich ecosystem and compatibility with libraries, editors and IDEs based on a unified
  [graphql-config](/blog/graphql-config)
- A powerful plugin system to extend GraphQL CLI with custom commands — supported by the community
  and The Guild

> The main target of the GraphQL CLI is to provide a default entry point for the community to use
> proven techniques for building and deploying GraphQL enabled applications while being vendor
> agnostic.

Advanced developers and tool creators can **extend**
[graphql-cli](https://github.com/urigo/graphql-cli) to provide additional capabilities while still
benefiting from a robust set of default commands for daily use — We want to use the CLI to encourage
open collaborations between different tool creators.

## History

Over the years the GraphQL ecosystem flourished and evolved towards more production-ready use cases
with a large number of active community packages available.

GraphQL evolved thanks to the large community and the many supporting libraries it has created.

The GraphQL CLI has become a place for the community to share ideas and best practices across
different solutions and libraries thanks
[to the push from Prisma](https://prisma.io/blog/new-tooling-to-improve-your-graphql-workflows-7240c81e1ba3).

[The Guild took over GraphQL CLI](https://prisma.io/blog/the-guild-takes-over-oss-libraries-vvluy2i4uevs)
to continue on that promise:

- Making it as easy as possible create and deploy GraphQL based applications
- Making it easier to maintain production-grade, scalable GraphQL applications

All of that while:

- Keeping the CLI updated with the latest solutions and practices
- Making it extensible and configurable without any solution bias — any approach and architecture
  could easily integrate and benefit from the CLI
- Keeping the industry leading, long term open source library maintenance standard that The Guild is
  known for

## Try It Out Today

We've already refactored most of the code, created a new structure, closed and fixed all the known
issues and released a new alpha version.

Install new version (follow the latest alpha in the
[releases page](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-cli/releases)):

```sh
npm install graphql-cli@canary
```

Create a new project with GraphQL CLI by running:

```sh
graphql init
```

GraphQL CLI will guide you and after only few seconds, your project will be ready to use!

## End-To-End Type Safety

Code generation + end-to-end type safety is a hot topic nowadays. Thanks to tools like
[**GraphQL Code Generator**](https://graphql-code-generator.com) we're able to produce flexible code
for both backend and frontend, just from GraphQL Schema and Operations with Fragments.

In GraphQL CLI, you get it out of the box by running:

```sh
graphql codegen
```

> _Discover what can be generator on [GraphQL Codegen website](https://graphql-code-generator.com)._

## Production Ready GraphQL Backend

Thanks to integration with [**GraphBack**](https://graphback.dev), you're able to produce an entire
Data Base, GraphQL schema with operations and strongly typed resolvers.

```sh
graphql generate
```

> Take a look at [GraphBack website](https://graphback.dev) to learn more.

## Bulletproof Your GraphQL API

GraphQL CLI comes with most of the features of
[**GraphQL Inspector**](https://graphql-inspector.com)**.**

With just few simple commands you're able to:

- detect breaking or dangerous changes
- validate Operations and Fragments at build time
- analyze the usage of GraphQL Schema (unused types and fields)
- find duplicates and similar GraphQL Types
- serve faked GraphQL schema

```sh
graphql diff
graphql similar
graphql validate
graphql coverage
graphql serve
```

## This Is Just the Start!

The GraphQL CLI has been rewritten in order to make it extremely customizable and extensible.

Our goal is to make sure that any tool can work and benefit from this setup.

The CLI offers freedom for anyone to create any command that will extend their workflows by creating
separate library. Alternatively you can open a conversation about new command that can be included
into our supported set of commands.

If you prefer to use all the Apollo toolings and products, AppSync's solutions, Prisma, OneGraph,
Hasura, Postgraphile or any other tool — we want to make the GraphQL CLI the best supporting tool
for your stack.

> We won't impose any choices on the users. We want the community to lead and have template
> generators for any technology.

This project is completely open and free from any bias, and we are open to any feedback and
collaboration with anyone from the community. Please reach out!

## Example Use Cases of GraphQL CLI

The CLI gives you the ability to build a base template with your favorite stack and tools.

Templates can be based on graphql.js, Apollo, Nexus, TypeGraphQL or anything other framework.
Creating a custom template may help to enforce a specific structure that fits your product and
company.

The CLI comes with two default templates that provide a seamless starting point for both backend and
frontend, both could be pushed to production in a short time period.

Additionally, for existing applications, the CLI will support migrating existing databases or REST
API to GraphQL.

## Production-Ready GraphQL App in Seconds

> Or "Making GraphQL easy — From nothing to a full production-ready app in 2 minutes — with any
> stack!""

There are many great GraphQL boilerplate repositories on available Github.

But when using those, it is often hard to adjust those to real business cases.

As an alternative to sample apps, developers can rely on frameworks that provide a high level of
abstraction.

But technologies that offer rapid application development might often come at the cost of the
maintenance and flexibility that can seriously limit the extensibility of your application server.

```sh
graphql init
```

We believe that making it easy to start with GraphQL is extremely important, but without sacrificing
other factors like extensibility, scalability and wider control.

> Simple shouldn't equal bad architecture

GraphQL CLI addresses this very important problem in the core by utilizing two main concepts: code
generation and rich ecosystem of base templates.

The `graphql init` command is trying to address three simple questions:

- _Can we build an application template that can offer production-ready capabilities and yet is
  simple enough to work without extensive learning?_
- _Can we provide our data model as input to the GraphQL engine and benefit from autogenerated data
  access methods?_
- _Can we use the same techniques for an existing application and generate partial models?_

> You can think of it as a smarter `create-react-app`, that works on a full-stack and understands
> your data model.

We are calling leading boilerplate creators and frameworks to collaborate with us. We can help you
expose your boilerplates also as templates for the init command.

We would also love feedback from internal infrastructure teams from companies who wish to create
their own best practices and guidelines.

## One Config to Rule Them All — GraphQL Config

_At the heart of a project created using GraphQL CLI is the GraphQL Config file. It lets the CLI
know where all the GraphQL parts are._

Config is essential for CLI templates and for the command creators that can utilize its
extensibility to save additional metadata. Thanks to [`graphql-config`](https://graphql-config.com),
the CLI can provide seamless support for every extension and streamline development experience on
top of the GraphQL CLI generated projects and corresponding templates.
