There will be times when we would like to pass props and control the behavior of child elements. Let
me explain. Let's take the following modal for example:

![](/medium/f8270eba98b7fce153579c2607ca2eb8.png)

As you can see, the modal contains the following elements:

- A title.
- An `x` button.

- Some text content.
- A dismiss button (“Close”).
- An action button (“Save changes”).

These elements should be modifiable if we would like the modal to be properly re-usable. That means
that the user would have control over things like the displayed content, dispatched events, style,
etc, **of each and every element**. A naive solution would be accepting distinct props for each
element like so:

```jsx
<Modal
  showCloseButton
  showDismissButton
  showActionButton
  title="Modal title"
  contents="Modal body text goes here."
  dismissButtonText="Close"
  actionButtonText="Save changes"
  handleDismiss={close}
  handleAction={save}
/>
```

The problem with that approach is that it spams the props mechanism; it makes the component look
inflated and less readable. Moreover, it limits the amount of props that can be passed to child
elements, and prevents the user from having a full control over them. You can solve this problem
however, by providing a series or generic props objects, where each one represents a different
element respectively:

```jsx
<Modal
  showCloseButton
  title="Modal title"
  contents="Modal body text goes here."
  dismissButtonProps={{
    text: 'Close',
    handler: close
  }}
  actionButtonProps={{
    text: 'Save changes',
    handler: save
  }}
/>
```

This solution works, but then again, it doesn't solve the spamming issue, plus, we completely abuse
the syntactic sugar that JSX provides us with. Instead of using HTML style attribute assignments
(`attr="value"`), we're obligated to use JSONs.

## Bootstrap for the Rescue

In Bootstrap they took a very clever approach. Instead of defining props all over the place, they
gave us the ability to directly manipulate the modal's children. Using dedicated components, we can
achieve the intended functionality that Bootstrap was aiming for:

```jsx
<Modal.Dialog>
  <Modal.Header closeButton>
    <Modal.Title>Modal title</Modal.Title>
  </Modal.Header>

  <Modal.Body>
    <p>Modal body text goes here.</p>
  </Modal.Body>

  <Modal.Footer>
    <Button variant="secondary" onClick={close}>
      Close
    </Button>
    <Button variant="primary" onClick={save}>
      Save changes
    </Button>
  </Modal.Footer>
</Modal.Dialog>
```

Great! There's definitely a progress right there. But we can even take it a step further.

Even though things are very declarative and clear with Bootstrap's approach, **we're still obligated
to compose the entire modal**. This means that we cannot use the modal's children to fill-up the
missing pieces, as if part of the logic was already implemented. It's not always that we would like
to write the modal's contents entirely from scratch, right? Sometimes we would like to use it like
some sort of template. Another point to consider, is that there's no filter or restrictions on the
children's input. Sometimes we would like the user to use only certain elements, and thus make sure
that he doesn't mess things up. If so, what's the right approach that goes along with it?

## Introducing the Design Pattern That Has It All

Let's recap. Based on what we gathered so far, the new design pattern should have the following
characteristics:

- No spamming of the props mechanism.
- Has full control over child elements using `props.children`.

- Has a template already in place.
- Has restrictions on the input.

Now that sounds promising. Let's have a look at an example. We will use the Bootstrap `Modal`
component as an anchor:

```jsx
const ModalFromTheFuture = ({ showCloseButton, children }) => {
  const childProps = useChildProps(props.children, [
    'title',
    'contents',
    'dismissButton',
    'actionButton'
  ])

  return (
    <Modal.Dialog>
      <Modal.Header closeButton={showCloseButton}>
        {childProps.title && <Modal.Title {...childProps.title} />}
      </Modal.Header>

      <Modal.Body>{childProps.contents && <p {...childProps.contents} />}</Modal.Body>

      <Modal.Footer>
        {childProps.actionButton && <Button {...childProps.actionButton} variant="secondary" />}
        {childProps.dismissButton && <Button {...childProps.dismissButton} variant="primary" />}
      </Modal.Footer>
    </Modal.Dialog>
  )
}
```

As you can see, the new modal component uses a hook called `useChildProps()`. This hook will go
through \`props.children\` and will basically flatten nested props. In addition, it will validate
them against a provided white list, to make sure that the right element names were addressed. This
is how its implementation should look like:

```jsx
const useChildProps = (children, whitelist) => {
  return useMemo(() =>
    [].concat(children).reduce(
      (childProps, child) => {
        if (whitelist && !whitelist.includes(child.type)) {
          throw Error(`element <${child.type}> is not supported`)
        }

        childProps[child.type] = child.props

        return childProps
      },
      [children]
    )
  )
}
```

```jsx
<ModalFromTheFuture showCloseButton>
  <title>Modal title</title>
  <contents>Modal body text goes here.</contents>
  <dismissButton onClick={close}>Close</dismissButton>
  <actionButton onClick={save}>Save changes</actionButton>
</ModalFromTheFuture>
```

True, but that can also be said about any other React component. Ever since the introduction of
component based UI (e.g. Angular, React, Vue or even Web components), new tag names aren't so rare
to come across by, therefore you shouldn't be afraid to use the new design pattern.
