# Issue #1

<LookingForExperts />

Hi there,

Our commitment to the GraphQL Ecosystem is stronger than ever, with more than
[15 active projects](/open-source) used by thousands of developers, participating in the GraphQL
Foundation projects, and working with many companies to help them get the best of GraphQL.

We felt that we could do a better job at making it easier to follow the evolution of our ecosystem
and share our tips and knowledge.

For this reason, we are happy to share with you this first issue of The Guild Newsletter, a monthly
newsletter that will share:

- The Guild and GraphQL Foundation projects releases
- Blogposts about GraphQL
- Tips on how to get the best of our tools

Starting our newsletter is a long-time due project, and we feel that this month is the perfect
timing to start with the recent launch of [GraphQL Yoga v2](https://graphql-yoga.com) and our first
product: [GraphQL Hive](https://graphql-hive.com/).

## Announcements

### Meet The Guild Team at the GraphQL SF Meetup on June 6th üóì

We are very excited to have all The Guild members visiting to SF together (for the first time!) and
join the GraphQL SF Meetup!

This meetup will be the occasion to share our vision of the future of The Guild and especially to
answer all your questions during a dedicated AMA.

[‚û°Ô∏è Registrations are already open](https://meetup.com/GraphQL-SF), we can't wait to meet you!

You are part of a company based in SF? [Let's meet!](mailto:contact@the-guild.dev)

### GraphQL Yoga V2 Is Available! üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

GraphQL Yoga, our GraphQL Server library, recently reached a huge milestone: the v2 version!

With the growing community of tools in the GraphQL space, most recently
[Envelop](https://envelop.dev), we were able to rewrite GraphQL Yoga 2.0 from scratch with easy
setup, performance, and developer experience at the core.

Discover all the new features brought by the v2 in the
[launch article](/blog/announcing-graphql-yoga-v2),
[its dedicated GraphQL video](https://graphql.wtf/episodes/36-graphql-yoga-2) or by following the
[Yoga tutorial](https://graphql-yoga.com/tutorial/basic/00-introduction).

We already received many positive feedback and great adoption with
[RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) and [Parse Platform](https://parseplatform.org) switching to Yoga
as their default GraphQL server.

More is coming with soon, a new [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start) GraphQL Yoga
driver, stay tuned!

### GraphQL Hive, Our First Open-Source SaaS Product üöÄ

Today is a big day for us: we are releasing our first open-source SaaS product, GraphQL Hive.

GraphQL Hive aims to help GraphQL developers to get to know their GraphQL APIs a little more with
our schema registry, monitoring, alerts, and integrations.

This new open source project comes with its managed SaaS alternative, with a generous free ‚ÄúHobby‚Äù
plan.

Get started by reading our [launch article](/blog/announcing-graphql-hive-public).

### GraphQL Foundation

The Guild is a member of the [GraphQL Foundation](https://graphql.org/foundation) whose mission is
to ensure that the GraphQL community is able to focus on the continued evolution of the
specification and reference implementations.

We are happy to announce that The Guild is now the new maintainer of the
[DataLoader project](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader).

We started a maintenance plan that includes TypeScript support, and better documentation:
https://github.com/graphql/dataloader/issues/297.

Finally, [Benjie from PostGraphile](https://github.com/benjie), started the
["GraphQL Composite Schemas Working Group"](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/pull/977)
initiative. The evolution of the GraphQL ecosystem brought many different solutions to compose
multiple GraphQL Schemas (Hasura GraphQL Joins, Apollo Federation, GraphQL Modules, GraphQL Tools,
etc).

The goal of this working group would be to define a spec to avoid a proliferation of standards.

If you are working in this field or are interested in the subject, we highly encourage you to join
this WG:
[https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/pull/977](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/pull/977).

## The Guild Ecosystem

### A Better Documentation Experience

_New documentation search_

![New search experience](/newsletter-assets/issue-1/search.png)

As most of our projects grow, we realized that it might be sometimes difficult to quickly find the
searched content.

For this reason, we are happy to release a new search experience that allows you to search across
all of our projects, thanks to a unified UI.

We already have many improvements listed for this first beta version of the new search, all feedback
is more than welcome:
[https://github.com/the-guild-org/the-guild-components/issues/372](https://github.com/the-guild-org/the-guild-components/issues/372).

> More collaborative documentation

Most of our documentation now provides an **Edit on GitHub** link, to ease feedback and
collaboration, along with a brand new comment system!

### GraphQL Code Generator

First, we would like to thank all of you since GraphQL Code Generator recently crossed the **1.4
million weekly downloads on NPM** üéâ

We lately put a lot of effort into codegen by first improving
[its documentation](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started) with better Getting
started content and new Guides for major frameworks and setups.

You will find below the list of ‚Äúnot-to-miss‚Äù updates released since the beginning of the year:

**Introducing Document Driven Applications and Fragment Masking**

Fragment Masking is a popular technique, that so far has been exclusive to Relay users. We built a
new plugin preset on top of
[`TypedDocumentNode`](https://graphql-code-generator.com/plugins/typed-document-node) that allows
using fragment masking with any GraphQL client or framework. This will help more people build
data-driven self-contained components. We are already using it heavily within Hive!

Learn more on the
[gql-tag-operations-preset](https://graphql-code-generator.com/plugins/gql-tag-operations-preset)
and
[fragment masking](https://graphql-code-generator.com/plugins/gql-tag-operations-preset#fragment-masking).

**Codegen performance**

Many improvements have been made to codegen performance, make sure to update all your
`@graphql-codegen/*` packages to the last version!

**Merge similar Fragment types**

Some of you have reported some issues related to the usage of Node interface design that leads to
poor type resolution and heavy generated types.

Thankfully, [@asmundg](https://github.com/asmundg) provided a new option
(`mergeFragmentTypes: true`) for all typescript plugins that enable merging ‚Äúsimilar fragments‚Äù.

More information is available on the related PR:
[https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/pull/7799](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/pull/7799)

### GraphQL Mesh

[GraphQL Mesh](https://graphql-mesh.com), our project for automatically turning any API (REST,
OpenAPI/Swagger, gRPC, SOAP and more) into a queryable GraphQL API saw major improvements in the
last couple of months.

First, similarly to GraphQL Code Generator, we
[completely revamped the GraphQL Mesh documentation](https://graphql-mesh.com/docs/introduction).
Getting started and learning the concepts is now a lot easier!

Mesh's ongoing ambitious work aims to provide a better developer experience, stronger handlers, and
cross-platform support.

Here is a summary of what to expect from the last releases:

**Cross-platform support**

This initiative is initially born from
[our collaboration with The Graph](https://thegraph.com/blog/guild-announcement) in building The
Graph client to query multiple GraphQL APIs as a unified schema, from the client-side.

Following those requirements, GraphQL Mesh is now 100% browser compatible, and we will continue
efforts to improve this support (smaller bundler, etc).

Finally,
[GraphQL Mesh server architecture](https://graphql-mesh.com/docs/getting-started/customize-mesh-server)
has been completely rewritten with GraphQL Yoga and Envelop, making GraphQL Mesh easier to deploy to
the most server and serverless environments.

You will find more information on how to deploy GraphQL Mesh on Serverless
[in our documentation](https://graphql-mesh.com/docs/getting-started/deploy-mesh-gateway).

**Better developer experience**

The experience of GraphQL Mesh users has been improved thanks to improved logging and a complete
rewrite of the server architecture.

GraphQL Mesh now relies on GraphQL Yoga and Envelop, you can easily customize the Envelop plugins
[by simply providing plugin lists](https://graphql-mesh.com/docs/getting-started/customize-mesh-server)
([see the new experimental declarative plugin configuration](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/commit/893d526abbaa39ef9fae55eb2ae26f6dbb4d52aa))
or a JavaScript file.

**OpenAPI handler rewrite**

With the goal to provide a more stable and performance OpenAPI handler, the existing `openapi`
handler will be soon sunset and replaced by the `new-openapi`.

This change will come with a migration guide.

In the meantime, we highly advise you to give a try to the `new-openapi` handler to anticipate
changes in the generated GraphQL Schema.

2022 is going to be an important year for GraphQL Mesh, stay tuned!

### Envelop

The v2 of Envelop, our GraphQL servers plugin system has been released!

This version brings performance improvement and one breaking change:

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
  We highly recommend avoiding using any plugins that use `onResolversCalled` within your production
  environment as it has a severe impact on the performance of the individual resolver functions
  within your schema.
</Callout>

Finally, as you may know,
[we believe that open source projects should live under a person's name](/about-us) - this way it
promotes the person and not just the company, and also it creates a more healthy ownership model.

Given his commitment to Envelop, we are happy to announce that the Envelop repository has been
transferred to [Laurin](https://github.com/n1ru4l)!

### KitQL

KitQL is a new library built exclusively for SvelteKit, leveraging each and every possibility of
this fantastic way of building apps.

It's making use of our EcoSystem & Best Practices like [GraphQL-Yoga](https://graphql-yoga.com) (for
the server), [GraphQL-Modules](http://graphql-modules.com) (to organize things nicely),
[GraphQL-ESLint](https://github.com/B2o5T/graphql-eslint) (to respect coding rules) and A fully
typed dedicated client abusing `fetch` & stores mechanisms.

If you are in SvelteKit and want to use GraphQL (client and/or server), it's definitely the way to
go.

Check our videos and all other resources here: [Get started with KitQL](https://kitql.dev/docs).
