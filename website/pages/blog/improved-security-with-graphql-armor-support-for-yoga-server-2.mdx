We are utterly excited to introduce
[GraphQL Armor](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/graphql-armor) compatibility with Yoga 2.

## When the GraphQL Ecosystem Encounters Security

A few weeks ago, the GraphQL Security company [Escape](https://escape.tech) released GraphQL Armor,
an open-source middleware to add a security layer on top of GraphQL endpoints and mitigate common
attacks.

GraphQL Armor blocks abusive requests by putting reasonable and clever limits to Queries. To us,
this represents the go-to solution when using
[persisted operations](https://envelop.dev/plugins/use-persisted-operations) is not possible, like
when building a public GraphQL API. Also, even if you are building an internal API, these tools can
be handy for preventing too heavy GraphQL queries. This technical approach is also complementary to
the existing set of plugins for hardening endpoints:

- [GraphQL Authz](/blog/graphql-authz) and
  [use-operation-field-permissions](https://envelop.dev/plugins/use-operation-field-permissions) for
  Access Control & Business logic
- [use-generic-auth](https://envelop.dev/plugins/use-generic-auth) and
  [use-auth0](https://envelop.dev/plugins/use-auth0) for Authorization

Thus, we decided to work together with Escape's team to continuously improve security standards and
defaults for the Yoga and GraphQL community.

> Why couldn't you have production security best practices in Yoga by default?

## What Do You Get by Using GraphQL Armor?

Armor comes out of the box with a set of plugins that applies security best practices to any
production GraphQL Server:

- Aliases Limit
- Character Limit
- Cost Limit
- Depth Limit
- Directives Limit
- Disabled Field Suggestion

More rules are added weekly. And we are more than open to feedback and contributions!

Note that the default configuration has been designed with conservation in mind: Adding Armor to a
production project should not interfere with legitimate requests out of the box.

## How Does It Look like to Use GraphQL Armor with Yoga?

GraphQL Armor relies on Envelop plugins for its security rules.

Getting started is dead-simple: `npm install -S @escape.tech/graphql-armor` (or
`yarn add @escape.tech/graphql-armor`)

Then let's take a minimalistic Yoga server:

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import { schema } from './schema'

export function initServer() {
  const server = createServer({
    schema
  })
  return server
}
```

Adding GraphQL armor is just a matter of adding a few envelop plugins:

```ts
import { EnvelopArmor } from '@escape.tech/graphql-armor'
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import { schema } from './schema'

const armor = new EnvelopArmor()
const enhancements = armor.protect()

export function initServer() {
  const server = createServer({
    schema,
    plugins: [...enhancements.plugins]
  })
  return server
}
```
