Resolvers are the fundamental building blocks of a GraphQL server. To build a robust and scalable
GraphQL server, we must understand how to write GraphQL resolvers effectively. In this blog post, we
will explore:

- how resolvers work
- concepts such as resolver map, resolver chain, defer resolve and mappers
- tools and best practices

## Glossary

- **Resolver map**: An object containing resolvers that match the types and fields in the GraphQL
  schema.
- **Resolver chain**: The order of resolvers execution when the GraphQL server handles a request.
- **Mapper**: The shape of the data returned by a resolver to become the `parent` parameter of the
  next resolver in the resolver chain.
- **Defer resolve**: A technique to avoid unnecessary resolver execution of a field early in the
  resolver chain.

## What Are Resolvers?

In a GraphQL server, a resolver is a function that "resolves" a value which means doing arbitrary
combination of logic to return a value. For example:

- returning a value statically
- fetching data from a database or an external API to return a value
- executing a complex business logic to return a value

Each field in a GraphQL schema has an optional corresponding resolver function. When a client
queries a field, the server executes the resolver function to resolve the field.

Given this example schema:

```graphql filename="src/graphql/schema.graphql"
type Query {
  movie(id: ID!): Movie
}

type Movie {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  actors: [Actor!]!
}

type Actor {
  id: ID!
  stageName: String!
}
```

We can write a **resolver map** like this:

```ts filename="src/graphql/resolvers.ts"
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    movie: () => {} // `Query.movie` resolver
  },
  Movie: {
    id: () => {}, // `Movie.id` resolver
    name: () => {}, // `Movie.name` resolver
    actors: () => {} // `Movie.actors` resolver
  },
  Actor: {
    id: () => {}, // `Actor.id` resolver
    stageName: () => {} // `Actor.stageName` resolver
  }
}
```

We will discuss how the code flows through resolvers when the server handles a request in the next
section.

## Code Flow and Resolver Chain

Using the same schema, we may send a query like this:

```graphql
query Movie {
  movie(id: "1") {
    id
    name
    actors {
      id
      stageName
    }
  }
}
```

Once the server receives this query, it starts at `Query.movie` resolver, and since it returns a
nullable `Movie` object type, two scenarios can happen:

- If `Query.movie` resolver returns `null` or `undefined`, the code flow stops here, and the server
  returns `movie: null` to the client.
- If `Query.movie` resolver returns anything else (e.g. objects, class instances, number, non-null
  falsy values, etc.), the code flow continues. Whatever being returned - usually called
  **mapper** - will be the first argument of the Movie resolvers i.e. `Movie.id` and `Movie.name`
  resolvers.

This process repeats itself until a GraphQL scalar field needs to be resolved. The order of the
resolvers execution is called the **resolver chain**. For the example request, the resolver chain
may look like this:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Query.movie] --> B(Movie.id)
  A[Query.movie] --> C(Movie.name)
  A[Query.movie] --> D(Movie.actors)
  D --> E(Actor.id)
  D --> F(Actor.stageName)
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  There are four positonal arguments of a resolver function:
  - `parent`: the value returned by the parent resolver.
    - For root-level resolvers like `Query.movie`, `parent` is always `undefined`.
    - For other object-type resolvers like `Movie.id` and `Movie.name`, `parent` is the value returned by parent resolvers like `Query.movie`
  - `args`: this is the arguments passed by client operations. In our example query, `Query.movie` resolver would receive `{ id: "1" }` as `args`
  - `context`: An object passed through the resolver chain. It is useful for passing information between resolvers, such as authentication information, database connection, etc.
  - `info`: An object containing information about the operation, such as operation AST, path to the resolver, etc.
</Callout>

We must return a value that can be handled by the scalars. In our example:

- `Movie.id` and `Actor.id` resolvers must return a non-nullable value that can be coerced into the
  `ID` scalar i.e. `string` or `number` values.
- `Movie.name` and `Actor.stageName` resolver must return a non-nullable value that can be coerced
  into the `String` scalar i.e. `string`, `boolean` or `number` values.

  You can learn about GraphQL Scalar, including native Scalar and coercion concept, in this guide
  [here](https://the-guild.dev/blog/the-complete-graphql-scalar-guide)
</Callout>

It is important to remember that we will encounter runtime errors if the resolver returns unexpected
values. Some common scenarios are:

- a resolver returns `null` to a non-nullable field
- a resolver returns a value that cannot be coerced into the expected scalar type
- a resolver returns a non-array value to an array field, such as `Movie.actors`

## How to Implement Resolvers

### Implementing Resolvers - Or Not

If an empty resolver map is provided to the GraphQL server, the server still tries to handle
incoming requests. However, it will return `null` for every root-level field in the schema. This
means if a root-level field like `Query.movie`'s return type is non-nullable, we will encounter
runtime error.

If object type resolvers are omitted, the server will try to return the property of the same name
from `parent`. Here's what `Movie` resolvers may look like if they are omitted:

```ts
const resolvers = {
  Movie: {}, // ðŸ‘ˆ Empty `Movie` resolvers object,
  Movie: undefined, // ðŸ‘ˆ or undefined/omitted `Movie` resolvers object...

  // ðŸ‘‡ ...are the equivalent of the following `Movie` resolvers:
  Movie: {
    id: parent => parent.id,
    name: parent => parent.name,
    actors: parent => parent.actors
  }
}
```

This means if `Query.movie` resolver returns an object with `id`, `name`, and `actors` properties,
we can omit the `Movie` and `Actor` resolvers:

```ts
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    movie: () => {
      return {
        id: '1',
        name: 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince',
        actors: [
          { id: '1', stageName: 'Daniel Radcliffe' },
          { id: '2', stageName: 'Emma Watson' },
          { id: '3', stageName: 'Rupert Grint' }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  // ðŸ’¡ `Movie` and `Actor` resolvers are omitted here but it still works,
  // Thanks to default resolvers!
}
```

In this very simple example where we are returning static values, this will work. However, in a
real-world scenario where we may fetch data from a database or an external API, we must consider the
response data shape, and the app performance. We will try to simlulate a real-world scenario in the
next section.

### Implementing Resolvers for Real-World Scenarios

Below is an object this can be used as an in-memory database:

```ts
const database = {
  movies: {
    // Movies table
    '1': {
      id: '1',
      movieName: 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'
    }
  },
  actors: {
    // Actors table
    '1': {
      id: '1',
      stageName: 'Daniel Radcliffe'
    },
    '2': {
      id: '2',
      stageName: 'Emma Watson'
    },
    '3': {
      id: '3',
      stageName: 'Rupert Grint'
    }
  },
  movies_actors: {
    // Table containing movie-actor relationship
    '1': {
      // Movie ID
      actorIds: ['1', '2', '3']
    }
  }
}
```

We usually pass database connection through context, so we might update `Query.movie` to look like
this:

```ts
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    movie: (_, { id }, { database }) => {
      const movie = database.movies[id] // ðŸ”„ Database access counter: (1)

      if (!movie) {
        return null
      }

      return {
        id: movie.id,
        name: movie.movieName,
        actors: (database.movies_actors[id] || []).actorIds // ðŸ”„ (2)
          .map(actorId => {
            return database.actors[actorId] // ðŸ”„ (3), ðŸ”„ (4), ðŸ”„ (5)
          })
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This works, however, there are a few issues:

- We are accessing the database 5 times every time `Query.movie` runs (Counted using ðŸ”„ emoji in the
  previous code snippet). Even if the client may not request for `actors` field, this still happens.
  So, we are making unnecessary database calls. This is called **eager resolve**.
- We are mapping `movie.movieName` in the return statement. This is fine here, but our schema may
  scale to have multiple fields returning `Movie`, and we may have to repeat the same mapping logic
  in multiple resolvers.

To improve this implementation, we can use **mappers** and **defer resolve** to avoid unnecessary
database calls and reduce code duplication:

```ts
type MovieMapper = {
  // 1.
  id: string
  movieName: string
}
type ActorMapper = string // 2.

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    movie: (_, { id }, { database }): MovieMapper => {
      const movie = database.movies[id]

      if (!movie) {
        return null
      }

      return movie // 3.
    }
  },
  Movie: {
    name: (parent: MovieMapper) => parent.movieName, // 4.
    actors: (parent: MovieMapper, _, { database }): ActorMapper[] =>
      database.movies_actors[parent.id].actorIds // 5.
    // 6.
  },
  Actor: {
    id: (parent: ActorMapper) => parent, // 7.
    stageName: (parent: ActorMapper, _, { database }) => database.actors[parent].stageName // 8.
  }
}
```

1. We define a `MovieMapper` type to represent the shape of the object returned by `Query.movie`
   resolver.
2. Similarly, we define `ActorMapper` to be returned wherever `Actor` type is expected. Note that in
   this example, `ActorMapper` is a `string` representing the ID of an actor in this case, instead
   of an object.
3. The `MovieMapper` is returned by `Query.movie` resolver, and it becomes the `parent` of `Movie`
   resolvers in (4) and (5).
4. Since `MovieMapper` has `movieName` property, but the GraphQL type expects String scalar for
   `name` instead. So, we need to return the mapper's `movieName` to the schema's `Movie.name`
   field.
5. `MovieMapper` doesn't have `actors` property, so we must find all the related actors from the
   database. Here, we expect an array of `ActorMapper` (i.e. an array of `string`) to be returned,
   which is the `actorIds` array in the database. This just means the `parent` of each `Actor`
   resolver is a string in (7) and (8)
6. We can skip implementing `Movie.id` resolver because by default it passes `MovieMapper.id`
   property safely.
7. Because each `ActorMapper` is the ID of an actor, we return the `parent` instead of `parent.id`
8. Similarly, we use `parent` as the ID of the actor to fetch the actor's `stageName` from the
   database.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  By using **mappers** and **defer resolve** techniques, we avoid unnecessary database calls and
  reduce code duplication. The next time we need to write a resolver that returns `Movie`, `Actor`
  objects, we can simply return the corresponding mapper objects.
</Callout>

### Implementing Resolvers with Mappers and Defer Resolve Best Practices

We saw the benefits of using mappers and defer resolve in the previous section. Here are some
TypeScript best practices to keep in mind when implementing these techniques, failing to enforce
them may result in runtime errors:

- Mappers MUST be correctly typed as the return type of a resolver and the parent type of the next
  resolver.
- Object resolvers MUST be implemented if the expected schema field does not exist in the mapper or,
  the mapper's field cannot be coerced into the expected schema type of the same name.

At a small scale, it is easy to keep track of the types and mappers. However, as our schema grows,
it becomes harder to maintain the typing and remembering which resolvers to implement. This is where
tools like [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) and
[Server Preset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eddeee888/gcg-typescript-resolver-files) can be used:

- GraphQL Code Generator: generates TypeScript types for the resolvers, focusing on correct
  nullability, array and types.
- Server Preset: generates and wires up resolvers conveniently, and runs analysis to suggests
  resolvers that require implementation, reducing the risk of runtime errors.

To get started, install the required packages:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @graphql-codegen/cli @eddeee888/gcg-typescript-resolver-files
```

Next, create a `codegen.ts` file at the root of your project:

```ts filename="codegen.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@eddeee888/gcg-typescript-resolver-files'
import type { CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli'

const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: 'src/graphql/schema.graphql',
  generates: {
    'src/graphql': defineConfig({
      resolverGeneration: 'minimal'
    })
  }
}
export default config
```

Then, add mappers into `schema.mappers.ts` file, in the same directory as `schema.graphql`:

```ts filename="src/graphql/schema.mappers.ts"
type MovieMapper = {
  id: string
  movieName: string
}
type ActorMapper = string
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
Server Preset automatically detects and wires up mappers if they follow the convention:
1. The mappers are declared in a file in the same directory as the schema source file, and has the file name ending with `.mappers.ts` segment instead of the schema source file's extension. For example:
   - If your schema file is `schema.graphql`, the mappers file is `schema.mappers.ts`.
   - If your schema file is `schema.graphql.ts`, the mappers file is `schema.graphql.mappers.ts`.
2. The mapper type names are in the format of `<TypeName>Mapper` where `<TypeName>` is the GraphQL schema name. For example:
   - If the schema type is `Movie`, then the mapper type is `MovieMapper`.
</Callout>

Finally, run codegen to generate resolvers:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run graphql-codegen
```

We will see generated resolver files in `src/graphql` directory:

```ts filename="src/graphql/resolvers/Query/movie.ts"
import type { QueryResolvers } from './../../types.generated'

export const movie: NonNullable<QueryResolvers['movie']> = async (_parent, _arg, _ctx) => {
  /* Implement Query.movie resolver logic here */
}
```

```ts filename="src/graphql/resolvers/Movie.ts"
import type { MovieResolvers } from './../types.generated'

export const Movie: MovieResolvers = {
  /* Implement Movie resolver logic here */
  actors: async (_parent, _arg, _ctx) => {
    /* Movie.actors resolver is required because Movie.actors exists but MovieMapper.actors does not */
  },
  name: async (_parent, _arg, _ctx) => {
    /* Movie.name resolver is required because Movie.name exists but MovieMapper.name does not */
  }
}
```

```ts filename="src/graphql/resolvers/Actor.ts"
import type { ActorResolvers } from './../types.generated'

export const Actor: ActorResolvers = {
  /* Implement Actor resolver logic here */
  id: async (_parent, _arg, _ctx) => {
    /* Actor.id resolver is required because Actor.id exists but ActorMapper.id does not */
  },
  stageName: async (_parent, _arg, _ctx) => {
    /* Actor.stageName resolver is required because Actor.stageName exists but ActorMapper.stageName does not */
  }
}
```

By providing mappers, codegen is smart enough to understand that we want to defer resolve, and we
need to write logic for `Movie.actors`, `Movie.name`, `Actor.id` and `Actor.stageName` resolvers to
ensure we don't encounter runtime errors.

## Summary

In this article, we have explored how resolvers work in a GraphQL server resolver code flow and
**resolver chain**, and how to write resolvers effectively using **mappers** and **defer resolve**
techniques. Finally, we add GraphQL Code Generator and Server Preset to automatically generate
resolvers and their types to ensure strong type-safety and reduce runtime errors.
