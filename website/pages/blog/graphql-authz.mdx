Today we are excited to introduce GraphQL AuthZ - a new open-source library for adding authorization
layers in different GraphQL architectures.

## Intro

GraphQL AuthZ is a flexible modern way of adding an authorization layer on top of your existing
GraphQL microservices or monolith backend systems.

It plays well with both code-first and schema-first (SDL) development, supports different ways of
attaching authorization rules, has zero dependencies in the core package (aside from a peer
dependency on graphql-js), and keeps the schema clean from any authorization logic!

Also, GraphQL AuthZ has integration examples for all major GraphQL frameworks and libraries. Let's
dig a little deeper and break down the core features and how they can help you improve your GraphQL
developer experience.

## How Does It Work?

GraphQL AuthZ wraps the graphql.js execution phase and runs logic for enforcing defined
authorization rules before and after this phase. The key function from `graphql-js` that is
responsible for running the execution logic is named `execute`.

This simplified pseudo-code describes how the GraphQL AuthZ hooks into the process by wrapping the
`execute` function.

```typescript
import { execute as originalExecute } from 'graphql'

function execute(args) {
  const preExecutionErrors = runPreExecutionRules(args)
  if (preExecutionErrors) {
    return preExecutionErrors
  }
  const result = originalExecute(args)
  const postExecutionErrors = runPostExecutionRules(args, result)
  if (postExecutionErrors) {
    return postExecutionErrors
  }
  return result
}
```

By wrapping existing functionality we gain the following key benefits.

- Compatibility with modern GraphQL technologies providing ways to wrap the graphql.js `execute`
  function. Here are a few working examples for
  [Envelop](https://github.com/AstrumU/graphql-authz/tree/main/examples/packages/envelop),
  [GraphQL Helix](https://github.com/AstrumU/graphql-authz/tree/main/examples/packages/graphql-helix),
  [Apollo Server](https://github.com/AstrumU/graphql-authz/tree/main/examples/packages/apollo-server-code-first),
  and
  [express-graphql](https://github.com/AstrumU/graphql-authz/tree/main/examples/packages/express-graphql).
- The executable GraphQL schema does not contain any authorization logic allowing more flexible
  re-usage for other use-cases
- Authorization rules can be added on top of an existing remote GraphQL schema. GraphQL AuthZ can be
  added as a layer on your GraphQL gateway that composes smaller subgraphs into one big graph.
- Separation of the authorization logic into two phases
  - The pre-execution phase for static authorization rules based on the context and incoming
    operation
  - The post-execution phase for flexible authorization rules based on the execution result

## Failing Early in the Pre-Execution Phase

With GraphQL AuthZ it's possible to execute authorization logic before any of the resolvers have
been executed. This empowers you to fail the request in the early stage, send back an error and
reduce server workload.

This technique works the best for authorization logic that is not dependent on remote data sources.
For example, checking if the user is authenticated or has some certain role or permission.

```typescript
// creating pre-execution rules

const IsAuthenticated = preExecRule()(context => !!context.user)

const IsEditor = preExecRule()(context => context.roles.has('editor'))
```

However, if you need the flexibility for fetching data from a remote source such as a database
before you can determine whether an operation should be executed, you still have the power to
leverage those data sources with async code.

This technique is a perfect fit for mutation fields, as you want to avoid executing the mutation
operation if the user has insufficient permissions e.g. he does not own a specific resource.

```typescript
// user can only publish a post if he owns it

const CanPublishPost = preExecRule()(async (context, fieldArgs) => {
  const post = await db.posts.get(fieldArgs.postId)
  return post.authorId === context.user?.id
})
```

## Using the GraphQL Schema as a Data Source

By pursuing the GraphQL AuthZ approach your executable schema does not contain any authorization
logic. This simplifies using the executable schema as a data source. For example, instead of calling
a remote database using an interface attached to our context object directly, the `graphql` function
from `graphql.js` package could be called, with the executable schema as an argument along with
graphql operation. By doing this, the authorization layer is not dependent on the underlying
database(s), its architecture, and ORM(s). It is dependent only on the GraphQL schema which is a
dependency of the GraphQL authorization layer by design.

```typescript
// using schema as a data source inside pre-execution rule

const CanPublishPost = preExecRule()(async (context, fieldArgs) => {
  const graphQLResult = await graphql({
    schema: context.schema,
    source: `query post($postId: ID!) { post(id: $postId) { author { id } } }`,
    variableValues: { postId: fieldArgs.postId }
  })

  const post = graphQLResult.data?.post

  return post && post.author.id === context.user?.id
})
```

Authorization logic could require any kind of data fetched from different databases or
(micro)services. Some data points could even be resolved by third-party microservices or APIs that
are not part of the composed graph.

By using the GraphQL schema as the data source, authorization rules don't need to be aware of
complex implementation details or directly connect to different databases or microservices.

This makes GraphQL AuthZ extremely powerful, especially for subgraphs in a microservice architecture
with centralized gateway-level authorization.

All the subschemas could live without any authorization logic and a federated or stitched gateway
can leverage GraphQL AuthZ for actually applying global authorization logic for the whole graph
while leveraging the graph for fetching the data required for doing so, without having to be aware
of GraphQL resolver implementation details.

## Reduce Remote Procedure Calls with Post-Execution Rules

In addition to the pre-execution rules, GraphQL AuthZ also allows you to write post-execution rules.

Fetching remote data from within authorization rules is powerful but it adds overhead and requires
additional network roundtrips. In most cases, the data required for performing authorization logic
is closely related to entities fetched via the GraphQL operation selection set. You can avoid this
by performing authorization logic based on the execution result in the post-execution phase.

In your post-execution rules, you can specify a selection set for fetching additional data, related
to the rule target, that is required for running the rule.

For example, if your rule is attached to some object field it could require additional information
about sibling fields with their relations.

```typescript
// creating post-execution rule

const CanReadPost = postExecRule({
  selectionSet: '{ status author { id } }'
})(
  (context, fieldArgs, post, parent) =>
    post.status === 'public' || post.author.id === context.user?.id
)
```

By using this technique we reduce remote procedure calls to individual data sources by executing
authorization logic on top of GraphQL execution result that is enriched with the additional data
specified by the authorization rules. Since related data is often stored in the same place it can be
fetched from a data source in one roundtrip (via the GraphQL schema) instead of performing one
remote procedure call for the authorization and one call for the actual data populating.

## Microservices

With GraphQL AuthZ it is possible to implement a centralized gateway authorization layer as well as
microservice level authorization. You can choose between storing the whole authorization schema in a
holistic way on a stitched or federated gateway or having dedicated authorization schemas for each
subgraph/schema specified by your services. It is even possible to mix both approaches!

> “Shifting this configuration out of the gateway makes subschemas autonomous, and allows them to
> push their own configuration up to the gateway—enabling more sophisticated schema releases.” —
> [schema stitching handbook](https://github.com/gmac/schema-stitching-handbook/tree/master/stitching-directives-sdl)

The `@graphql-authz/directive` package provides a GraphQL directive that can be used to annotate
types and fields within your subschemas SDL and a configuration transformer that can be used on the
gateway to convert the subschema directives into explicit authorization settings.

```graphql
# using @authz directive

type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String! @authz(rules: [IsAdmin])
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post @authz(rules: [CanReadPost]) {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  body: String!
  status: Status!
  author: User!
}

type Query {
  users: [User!]! @authz(rules: [IsAuthenticated])
  post(id: ID!): Post
}

type Mutation {
  publishPost(postId: ID!): Post! @authz(rules: [CanPublishPost])
}
```

On top of that directives can as well be used in monolith architecture.

If you are not pursuing a schema-first (SDL) development flow and are more a fan of the code-first
approach (which does not let you specify directives without framework-specific voodoo magic), the
authorization schema can also be described as a plain JSON object. Allowing you to specify the rules
that should be executed on your object types, interfaces, and fields.

```typescript
// defining auth schema

const authSchema = {
  Post: { __authz: { rules: ['CanReadPost'] } },
  User: {
    email: { __authz: { rules: ['IsAdmin'] } }
  },
  Mutation: {
    publishPost: { __authz: { rules: ['CanPublishPost'] } }
  },
  Query: {
    users: { __authz: { rules: ['IsAuthenticated'] } }
  },
  // wildcards are supported. read more: https://github.com/AstrumU/graphql-authz#wildcard-rules
  '*': {
    __authz: { rules: ['Reject'] },
    '*': {
      __authz: { rules: ['IsAuthenticated'] }
    }
  }
}
```

## Comparing GraphQL AuthZ with GraphQL Shield

[GraphQL Shield](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield) is a great tool for creating
authorization layers that has vast adoption from the community. In fact, GraphQL AuthZ is highly
inspired by GraphQL Shield! However, GraphQL Shield uses a different approach compared to GraphQL
AuthZ for applying authorization rules.

The main difference is GraphQL Shield uses field middleware by wrapping all the `resolver` functions
within your GraphQL schema for executing authorization logic during the data-resolving phase, while
GraphQL AuthZ wraps the entire `execute` logic.

The benefits of the wrapping approach are described in previous paragraphs, however, there are also
some drawbacks. For example, with GraphQL AuthZ post-execution rules there is no ability to fail the
request early because post-execution rules are executed after all resolvers are executed. GraphQL
Shield, on the other hand, can fail the request during the execution phase which happens before the
post-execution phase but later than the pre-execution phase. On the other hand, post-execution rules
have the benefit of accessing the resolved value of the field they are specified on and,
furthermore, even the sibling fields that are specified via the rules selection set.

The middleware approach of GraphQL shield is missing these possibilities because authorization logic
is executed in the context of field resolvers and has access only to the parent object which is the
value returned from the parent field resolver. At that stage, the wrapped field resolvers have not
been executed yet.

Another feature in GraphQL Shield is the built-in contextual caching mechanism for rules. At the
moment, GraphQL AuthZ has no built-in caching, but you can implement it yourself within the GraphQL
AuthZ rules, or in the future caching could even become a built-in feature. (pull requests are more
than welcome)

## Which Approach to Choose?

Let's wrap up all the use-cases mentioned above and also give a library recommendation.

- If you have very few places that should be covered by authorization, and you don't plan to
  increase such places, you can just add authorization logic right inside resolvers to not
  overcomplicate things.
- If all of your authorization logic doesn't depend on the data and shouldn't perform complex
  calculations, you can use
  [operation-field-permissions](https://envelop.dev/plugins/use-operation-field-permissions)
  [Envelop](https://envelop.dev) plugin.
- If your authorization logic contains some calculations which are the same for many fields of your
  schema, you can use [GraphQL Shield](https://github.com/maticzav/graphql-shield) to leverage the
  built-in contextual caching mechanism.
- If your authorization logic heavily depends on the data, or you want to use schema directives to
  attach auth rules, you can use [GraphQL AuthZ](https://github.com/AstrumU/graphql-authz) to
  leverage the 'GraphQL schema as a data source' pattern and post-execution rules.
