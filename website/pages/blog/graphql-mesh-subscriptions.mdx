GraphQL Mesh lets you query any data source and protocol with GraphQL by using powerful handlers
(Swagger/OpenAPI, gRPC, SOAP and others...) Today we are happy to announce that GraphQL Mesh now
allows you to consume your existing HTTP Webhooks as GraphQL Subscriptions!

Not only that, but you could extend the GraphQL Subscriptions result, so you could subscribe to a
webhook and get back an enriched data result, with data from other sources that don't have push
communication abilities.

And it's also possible even if your webhooks don't have any schema!

Let's see how to create a GraphQL Subscription from a Webhook, once without a schema and once
automatically from an OpenAPI schema.

> schema by using our JSON Schema Handler. [See more](/blog/migrating-from-rest)

### Add a New Field to Our Existing Configuration for an HTTP Webhook

In the following example configuration, we have a regular GraphQL Mesh configuration for schemaless
REST API.

```yaml
sources:
  - name: Example
    handler:
      jsonSchema:
        baseUrl: http://localhost:4001
        operationHeaders:
          Content-Type: application/json
        operations:
          - type: Query
            field: todos
            path: /todos
            method: GET
            responseSample: ./todos.json
          - type: Mutation
            field: addTodo
            path: /todo
            method: POST
            requestSample: ./addTodo.json
            responseSample: ./todo.json
            responseTypeName: Todo
```

Assume that we point our REST API to send HTTP requests to our Mesh server's `/webhooks/todo_added`
path, so we need to configure Mesh to listen to that path.

```yaml
serve:
  port: 4000
  handlers:
    - path: /webhooks/todo_added
      pubsubTopic: todoAdded
```

Under `serve` we define the port we want Mesh to listen to and add a handler in a declarative way
without a single line of code. `pubsubTopic` is the unique name for that webhook. This topic will
receive upcoming HTTP requests so that JSON Schema handler will consume it as a GraphQL
Subscription.

Let's define a new field under `Subscription` field under `operations` in the handler level;

```yaml
operations:
  - type: Subscription
    field: todoAdded
    pubsubTopic: todoAdded
    responseSample: ./todo.json
```

Now we have a `todoAdded` field that listens to a webhook through Mesh's PubSub instance and this
field has a return type generated based on `todo.json` sample response.

You can start `mesh serve` and start listening for that webhook by the following GraphQL operation;

```graphql
subscription {
  todoAdded {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}
```

### Other Methods for Subscriptions Such as RabbitMQ or Kafka

It is possible to configure Mesh to handle other schemaless subscription solutions like RabbitMQ and
Kafka using JSON Schema handler but this is the topic of another blog post.

### Generating GraphQL Subscriptions from OpenAPI Callbacks

Mesh can listen to webhooks through a PubSub engine easily. Mesh will generate the necessary typings
and subscriptions fields connected to your PubSub engine from the OpenAPI schema. You only need Mesh
to know what path the server should listen to like below;

```yaml
sources:
  - name: OpenAPICallbackExample
    handler:
      openapi:
        source: ./openapi.yml
        baseUrl: http://localhost:4001

serve:
  port: 4000
  handlers:
    - path: /callback
      pubsubTopic: http://localhost:4000/callback
```

In this example configuration, we assume that we have an API server running on 4001 port and it has
a webhook that will forward requests from `/callback` path to `http://localhost:4000/callback` topic
because OpenAPI Handler uses callback url as PubSub topic name. If you want to have a more
customized way of handling incoming webhook requests, you can always write your own Express handler
and define it instead of `pubsubTopic`. You will find Mesh's PubSub engine under the `request`
object as `request.pubsub`.
