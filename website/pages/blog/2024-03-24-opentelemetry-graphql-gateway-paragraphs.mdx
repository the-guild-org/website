## The Importance of Monitoring GraphQL Gateways

GraphQL Gateways play a crucial role in modern API architectures, acting as the central point for
request routing, schema composition, and performance optimization. As these gateways handle
increasing amounts of traffic and complexity, monitoring their performance and behavior becomes
essential for maintaining reliable and efficient systems.

## Current State of GraphQL Gateway Monitoring

Traditionally, monitoring GraphQL Gateways has been challenging due to several factors. The
distributed nature of these systems, where gateways communicate with multiple subgraphs, makes it
difficult to trace requests across the entire system. The gateway's query planning phase, which
determines how to split and route queries across subgraphs, is a critical but often opaque process
that can significantly impact performance.

Complex queries that span multiple subgraphs make it challenging to identify which part of the
execution is causing slowness, whether it's the gateway's planning, a specific subgraph, or the
network communication. When errors occur, it's often difficult to trace whether they originate from
the gateway itself, a specific subgraph, or the communication between them, making debugging a
complex process.

## OpenTelemetry: A Game-Changer for GraphQL Monitoring

OpenTelemetry has emerged as a powerful solution for monitoring GraphQL Gateways. It provides
consistent APIs for collecting metrics, traces, and logs across different programming languages and
frameworks, offering standardized instrumentation that makes monitoring more reliable and
consistent. The ability to propagate context across service boundaries helps track requests through
the entire system, while its vendor-agnostic approach allows you to choose your preferred
observability backend.

As an open-source project, OpenTelemetry perfectly aligns with The Guild's values of transparency
and community-driven development. This commitment to openness ensures that the monitoring solution
can evolve with the community's needs and maintain high standards of quality and reliability.

## Key Metrics and Traces for GraphQL Gateways

When monitoring GraphQL Gateways with OpenTelemetry, several key aspects come into focus. The
request lifecycle tracing provides visibility into HTTP request/response flows and GraphQL operation
execution, including query parsing and validation timing. This comprehensive view helps understand
how requests are processed at each stage.

Subgraph communication monitoring reveals the interactions between the gateway and its subgraphs,
tracking upstream HTTP fetch calls, execution timing, and status. This information is crucial for
identifying bottlenecks and issues in the distributed system. Operation performance metrics,
including overall query execution time, subgraph-specific execution times, error rates, and request
throughput, provide the quantitative data needed to assess system health and performance.

## Hive Gateway's OpenTelemetry Integration

We're excited to announce significant improvements to Hive Gateway's OpenTelemetry integration.
These enhancements bring detailed request tracing across subgraphs, with automatic span creation for
schema operations and seamless context propagation between services. The integration provides
real-time performance metrics and detailed error tracking, enabling comprehensive resource
utilization monitoring.

The improved debugging capabilities include better error context, request/response correlation, and
performance bottleneck identification. These features make it easier to diagnose and resolve issues
in your GraphQL infrastructure.

## Getting Started with Hive Gateway's OpenTelemetry Integration

You can try the new OpenTelemetry integration with Hive Gateway by simply enabling it in your
gateway configuration! We support most used exporters out of the box, but you can also import your
own custom ones.

> If you don't already have a tracing backend setup, you can use our
> [OpenTelemetry example repository](https://github.com/the-guild-org/graphql-gateway-otel/tree/main/otel)
> to get started.

```typescript
import { createOtlpHttpExporter, defineConfig } from "@graphql-hive/gateway";
import { createOtlpHttpExporter, setupOpenTelemetry } from "@graphql-hive/opentelemetry-setup";

setupOpenTelemetry({
  exporters: [
    createOtlpHttpExporter({ url: "http://localhost:4317" }),
  ],
});

export const gatewayConfig = defineConfig({
  openTelemetry: {
    tracing: true,
  }
});
```

This configuration enables OpenTelemetry tracing with HTTP OTLP exporter. The exporter will
automatically set up the Node.js OpenTelemetry SDK and ensure trace context is properly propagated
across service boundaries.

## Future Improvements

The OpenTelemetry integration we're releasing today lays the foundation for several exciting future
improvements. Thanks to OpenTelemetry's unified context, metrics, logs, and traces will be
automatically correlated, making it easier to debug errors and performance issues. When a problem
occurs, you'll be able to jump from a slow query trace directly to the relevant logs and metrics,
providing a complete picture of what happened during problematic requests.

## Conclusion

Hive Gateway's new OpenTelemetry integration brings comprehensive monitoring capabilities to your
GraphQL infrastructure. By providing detailed traces, metrics, and logs with unified context, it
helps you identify and resolve issues faster, whether they're in the gateway, subgraphs, or the
communication between them.
