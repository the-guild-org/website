When building GraphQL APIs following a schema-first approach and the project goes big, people
usually find themselves repeating almost identical structures across the schema and copy-pasting
common fields across the different types and inputs.

## The Need of a New Language

The GraphQL schema definition language (commonly referred to as SDL) is really nice for writing API
schemas, but it tends to fall short on features as it is not a programming language (and it is not
meant to be).

With a code-first approach it is very easy to autogenerate repetitive graphql code as it is the
programming language of choice the one that does all the hard work, but with a schema-first approach
the limits are set by the capabilities of vanilla GraphQL.

There are points in favor of the schema-first approach:

- Non-programmers can contribute to new features by just touching the GraphQL schema.
- The GraphQL schema itself serves like a blueprint for developers who will implement the API.
- Frontend developers can start the work as long as the schema definition is complete, even before
  the backend team has finished implementing it.
- For customer facing APIs, it makes sense to give more importance to the schema definition, as it's
  what the customers will directly interact with.

GraphQXL is directed for people that want to keep using a schema-first approach but also want to
benefit from the code re-usability, consistency and maintainability that a programming language
would provide.

## Some Interesting Features

It is very common to reuse a subset of fields across many types, for example:

```graphql
type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  createdAt: Date
  modifiedAt: Date
  # ...
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  createdAt: Date
  modifiedAt: Date
  # ...
}
```

This pattern can be repeated in a lot of types in the same schema, leading to code duplication and
potential inconsistencies.

In GraphQXL this would look something like:

<Comparison>
```graphql filename="Source GraphQXL" copy=false
type _CommonFields {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  createdAt: Date
  modifiedAt: Date
}

type Product {
  ..._CommonFields
}

type User {
  ..._CommonFields
}
```
```graphql filename="Compiled GraphQL" copy=false
type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  createdAt: Date
  modifiedAt: Date
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  createdAt: Date
  modifiedAt: Date
}
```
</Comparison>

The idea is not only to reuse code instead of copy-pasting, but also to enforce consistency across
resources in the schema.

## Added Syntax for Enforcing Reusability

[Pagination based on cursors and connections](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) is one of
the most common and standard ways for providing pagination. This, implemented in a good number of
types, would lead to a bunch of verbose types with pretty much the same structure.

For example, this vanilla GraphQL code:

```graphql
"The Product's Edge object for pagination"
type ProductEdge {
  "The Product's cursor that refers to the current node"
  cursor: String!
  "The Product itself"
  node: Product!
}

"The Connection object for paginating across the ProductEdges"
type ProductConnection {
  "Metadata with the current page info"
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
  "List of ProductEdges for the current page"
  edges: [ProductEdge!]!
}

"The User's Edge object for pagination"
type UserEdge {
  "The User's cursor that refers to the current node"
  cursor: String!
  "The User itself"
  node: User!
}

"The Connection object for paginating across the UserEdges"
type UserConnection {
  "Metadata with the current page info"
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
  "List of UserEdges for the current page"
  edges: [UserEdge!]!
}
```

Verbose right? and this is just for a couple of resources, there is usually a lot more in a GraphQL
schema.

How could this be written using GraphQXL?

```graphql
"The ${{ variables.T }}'s Edge object for pagination"
type Edge<T> {
  "The ${{ variables.T }}'s cursor that refers to the current node"
  cursor: String!
  "The ${{ variables.T }} itself"
  node: T!
}

"The Connection object for paginating across the ${{ variables.T }}s"
type Connection<T> {
  "Metadata with the current page info"
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
  "List of ${{ variables.T }}s for the current page"
  edges: [T!]!
}

type ProductEdge = Edge<Product>
type ProductConnection = Connection<ProductEdge>
type UserEdge = Edge<User>
type UserConnection = Connection<UserEdge>
```

## Is There Something Else?

Of course! There is a lot more things that you can check in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/gabotechs/graphqxl), or in the
[GraphQXL Book](https://gabotechs.github.io/graphqxl).

You can also play around with it in the [GraphQXL explorer](https://graphqxl-explorer.vercel.app).

It would be awesome to hear opinions from the community and new feature requests that could solve
other challenges when defining GraphQL schemas.
