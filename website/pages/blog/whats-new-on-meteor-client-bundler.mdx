## Introduction to New Features of MCB

Meteor Client Bundler is a solution for packaging Meteor's official client packages into a single
module in order to use your projects not using Meteor CLI. Until last version, it is not possible to
use MCB on non-browser projects without some tricks such as React Native, Electron etc…

## New Features on MCB

- Generate stub modules for `meteor/[PACKAGE]` if you cannot use module-aliasing somehow. It is
  really challenging situation on Angular CLI and React Native CLI.
- Use external NPM modules from your client project's `node_modules` directory instead of adding it
  to the Meteor Client Bundle; this is required not to duplicate `react` for React Native projects.
- Possibility not to add `__meteor_runtime_config` , if you want to add it by yourself in your
  project. Especially, if you want to separate production and development URLs for Meteor backend

These features allow you to use directly Angular CLI and React Native CLI without the need of
ejecting any configuration file.

Also, there is other specific post about React Native CLI integration of Meteor without using 3rd
party libraries such as `react-native-meteor` or `react-meteor-data` which are copies of official
client libraries. The most important disadvantage of using these extra libraries is lack of code
sharing between Meteor and React Native project. Otherwise, Client Bundle generated by MCB allows
this.

_Special thanks to_ Urigo _for this great tool, and allowing me to modify the code to add these
features._
