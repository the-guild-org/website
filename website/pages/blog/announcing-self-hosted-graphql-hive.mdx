It has been five months since [we launched GraphQL Hive](/blog/announcing-graphql-hive-release) and
one year since [we first announced GraphQL Hive](/blog/graphql-hive-preview), and it has been a wild
ride since then!

> GraphQL Hive is our schema registry solution for continuously evolving your GraphQL schema backed
> by performance insights and usage statistics. Whether you are working in a small company with a
> single GraphQL service or a big multi-team company with multiple (federated or composed) GraphQL
> services, GraphQL Hive is the perfect tool to help you manage your GraphQL schema.

We first were surprised but also excited about the amount of interest from companies of all sizes
and industries and individuals from all over the world in GraphQL Hive. We are so grateful for all
the support, contributions and feedback we received so far from external contributors and are
looking forward to a bright future!

Aside from the diverse range of companies that are already successfully using our hosted GraphQL
Hive version, a lot of companies have been asking us whether it is possible to host your own GraphQL
Hive instance!

Since the beginning of the project, we had a different vision for SaaS and community editions of
GraphQL Hive compared to traditional SaaS products. Instead of only open-sourcing a small portion of
the whole stack we always wanted to open-source the full stack and make it easy for anyone to host
their own instance of GraphQL Hive.

Today, we are happy to announce that we have reached this milestone and spinning up your first
GraphQL Hive instance is as easy as running a single command! All you need is `docker` and
`docker-compose` installed on your machine.
