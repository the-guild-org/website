Last year we've released [GraphQL-Modules](https://graphql-modules.com) — which applies modular
approach to large scale, GraphQL-based applications.

We've also released a new version of [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com)
which generates server-side typings and signatures for resolvers from GraphQL Schemas.

Those are two separate projects, but because we use both in production across many different
applications, we wanted to write about the benefits of the tight integration of those projects and
how it provides us with great development experience while implementing our projects in TypeScript.

GraphQL Code Generator can take a JS/TS export from GraphQL-Modules to generate server-side typings
(or anything else that its [plugins can generate](https://graphql-code-generator.com/plugins)). So,
let's export typeDefs without any business logic that includes resolvers, DI, providers etc…

You can create a `schema.ts` file to expose `typeDefs` to GraphQL Code Generator:

```ts filename="schema.ts"
import { AppModule } from './modules/app'

export default AppModule.typeDefs

// If your module needs a configuration

export default AppModule.forRoot({ ...dummyConfiguration }).typeDefs
```

Create a `codegen.yml` config file, including `schema.ts` as a schema source, and generate
[common](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/typescript-common) and
[server](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/typescript-server) typings for TypeScript.
We use `transpile-only` to prevent errors related to TypeScript on typing generation phase to let
`ts-node` handle this on running the actual application.

```yaml filename="codegen.yml"
overwrite: true
schema: ./src/schema.ts
require:
  - ts-node/register/transpile-only
generates:
  ./src/generated-models.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - typescript-resolvers
    config:
      contextType: @graphql-modules/core#ModuleContext
```

We can add a script to `package.json` to run:

```jsonc
{
  //...
 "scripts": {
   //...
    "generate": "gql-gen",
    // You can use nodemon to watch changes on graphql files
    "generate:watch": "nodemon --exec yarn generate -e graphql",
   //...
 //...
}
```

Then, we can use these typings in our project. This example shows a resolvers handler that
implements resolvers for `Query` type with generated types.

```ts
import { UsersProvider } from '../providers/users.provider'
import { IResolvers } from '../../generated-models'

export default <IResolvers>{
  Query: {
    // all parameters and return value are typed
    users: (root, args, context, info) => context.injector.get(UsersProvider).getUsers(args)
  }
}
```

At the end, we have a strictly-typed backend project, based of separate feature modules, and each of
those modules uses GraphQL and TypeScript.

You can check our working example that is created by using this approach;
