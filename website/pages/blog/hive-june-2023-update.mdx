import { Callout } from '@theguild/components';


After shipping [Schema Policy](/blog/hive-introducing-schema-policy.mdx) last month we are happy to share with you some of the new features we worked on.

## Persisted schema checks

We now persist the schema checks and display them on the Hive Target page.
When using the GitHub integration we now also automatically link the GitHub check run to the schema check.
You can see a schema diff, policy errors and the supergraph in this new view.

In the future we will allow manual approvals of schema checks.


## Schema Coordinate Client Usage on Explorer

On the Explorer page we now show which clients are using a specific schema coordinate.
This is useful to understand which clients are affected by a schema change and which teams you need to contact for communicating an upcoming schema change.

<Callout>
  In the following example you can see that the `Mutation.schemaPublish` schema coordinate is used by `Hive Client`, `Hive CLI`, `Hive Ruby Client` and other unknown clients.
</Callout>

## Subgraph Information on Explorer

For Federation projects we now show the subgraph information on the Explorer page.
It is now easier to understand whcih types and fields are referenced from which subgraphs, which helps you doing strategic decissions.
