GraphQL Network Inspector is a dedicated devtools extension which allows you to inspect and debug
GraphQL queries and mutations from network traffic.

The extension has seen great adoption since its initial release in 2019 and now I'm excited to
announce it's new home as part of The Guild.

You can check out the open source extension and try it out today.

## Why GraphQL Network Inspector?

If you've ever worked with GraphQL on the client, you'll know that it can be a real pain to debug
using the standard network inspector. The standard devtools are designed for REST APIs and don't
provide clear visibility into the GraphQL queries and mutations being sent.

With every request you'll see `POST /graphql`. This makes it difficult to distinguish requests
without opening the request details and inspecting the body.

GraphQL Network Inspector solves this problem by providing a dedicated tab for GraphQL requests and
displaying each query in a readable format.

## Features Overview

The great thing about a dedicated inspector is we can provide much more specific functionality
around GraphQL. Here are some of the features we've added to the extension:

### Request Overview

The request overview tab provides a quick overview of all queries and mutations. Here you can see
queries by name and see a visual difference between queries and mutations.

### Request Details

Clicking into a request will show similar details to the standard network inspector. But here we
have a better breakdown for each element of the request including; headers, request query with
variables and response.

### Copy Details to GraphQL Playground

The extension also provides convenient buttons to copy the request query and variables into GraphQL
Playground.

Under the request details tab, you'll see a button to copy the query and variables to the clipboard.

You can also click individual headers to copy them.

Happy debugging!
