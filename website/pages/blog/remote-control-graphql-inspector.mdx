The new version of GraphQL Inspector comes with **remote control of Pull Requests and Pushes via
HTTP endpoint**. You're in charge of accepting or rejecting changes, even if they break the GraphQL
API.

We recently released a lot more interesting features. You can read about them in
["New GraphQL Inspector and upcoming features"](/blog/new-graphql-inspector) article.

## What Is Remote Control?

Think of it as a way to intercept Schema Checks done by GraphQL Inspector and report back a
conclusion:

> to fail or not to fail

Every Push or opened Pull Request is checked with GraphQL Inspector and based on the changes in a
schema, it decides whether to reject those changes. We don't want to stop you there so Inspector
lets you review changes and decide what to do.

The idea is simple. You create an HTTP endpoint, like serverless function or whatever and on every
Push or Pull Request we send you a list of changes with all the details (mainly criticality level)
and Inspector expects to receive back a conclusion and changes.

```javascript
export default (req, res) => {
  const changes = req.body.changes
  const conclusion = decide(changes)

  res.json({
    changes,
    conclusion
  })
}
```

The HTTP endpoint will also receive **details about a Pull Request or a Commit** that triggered the
schema check, so possibilities are endless here.

You're able to reject all Pull Requests done by your manager, even when there are no breaking
changes.

## Future Plans

We're working on **Azure and Bitbucket integrations** plus a **monitoring feature**. Talk to us to
try it out.

We want to make **Azure** and **Bitbucket** a first-class citizens in GraphQL Inspector and give you
the same experience as you get right now with **GitHub**.

**Monitoring** will enable you to analyze the traffic of your GraphQL APIs and provide details
needed to improve performance. Collecting information about the usage will let you safely remove
deprecated pieces of GraphQL Schema.

## Enjoy GraphQL Inspector!

We have big plans for Inspector, and you're very welcome to join us in that journey.

GraphQL Inspector is a tool created by developers, for developers and that's why we'd love to get
your feedback and shape GraphQL Inspector together!
