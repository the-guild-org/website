## New Name, AoT Support, TypeScript Improvements, and Angular 4 Readiness

We recently released version `0.11.0` of
[apollo-angular](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-angular) and a lot of things have changed
and improved since our last update blog!

First, here is an overview list of the main changes:

- New name
- Support for Apollo Client 0.8+
- AoT support
- Multiple Apollo Client instances in a single app
- TypeScript improvements and TypeScript codegen
- Apollo Client Developer Tools
- ES6 Modules and Tree Shaking
- Support for Angular 4

So let's dive into it!

## New Name

![](/medium/3b47588c7a195cbb887dad8db7fb8c7f.png 'After years of research we discovered a secret formula')

As you all know, the term “Angular 2” is
[no longer a thing](https://angularjs.blogspot.com/2017/01/branding-guidelines-for-angular-and.html),
now it's just “Angular”, without the version suffix (#justAngular). So we renamed the package to be
**“apollo-angular”**. We really wanted “angular-apollo” to match up with `react-apollo`, but it was
already taken. That means that from now on the “angular2-apollo” package is deprecated.

We've applied this rule to the service as well, so there is no “Angular2Apollo” anymore. It's just
**Apollo**. Simpler and more convenient. The migration process is very simple:

```ts
import { Angular2Apollo } from 'angular2-apollo'

class AppComponent {
  constructor(apollo: Angular2Apollo) {}
}
```

```typescript
import { Apollo } from 'apollo-angular'

class AppComponent {
  constructor(apollo: Apollo) {}
}
```

## Apollo Client 0.8

We've updated our dependency to apollo-client 0.8 which includes a lot of improvements in size and
performance. check out the full list
[here](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/apollo-client-0-8-e8db5efc75fb).

## Ahead-Of-Time Compilation

![](/medium/9eb65f486aae61db008b4b6f5bea90e3.png 'Ahead-of-Time Compilation')

One of the most interesting features of Angular is Ahead-of-Time compilation. Angular's compiler
converts the application, components, and templates to executable JavaScript code at build time. AoT
compilation improves the size of the app as well as the performance and stability thanks to
static-code analysis at build time.

![](/medium/063a3d092340209bd6e454e2fee4ac41.png 'Just-In-Time Compilation')

To support this feature, we had to change the way of providing ApolloClient to ApolloModule. Instead
of using an instance of ApolloClient directly, it has to be wrapped with a function. Here's an
example:

```ts
import { ApolloModule } from 'apollo-angular'
import { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-client'

const client = new ApolloClient()

function provideClient() {
  return client
}

ApolloModule.withClient(provideClient)
```

## Multiple Clients

![](/medium/251fe78b9075dac4e8088a4e174427e1.png 'Apollo service')

We're happy to introduce a support for multiple clients. Yes, it's now possible to use many
instances of the ApolloClient inside of the ApolloModule, meaning you can call multiple GraphQL
endpoints from your single client app.

The use case for this feature came from some of our enterprise users. Some common use cases are when
working with a server endpoint as well as a 3rd party API, or in case you are calling multiple
microservices GraphQL endpoints from on client app. While it's always better to have all of your
data in one GraphQL service to be able to get all of the data you need in one request, sometimes
it's unavoidable to have to call multiple APIs.

We decided to make it as an optional feature and to implement it in a way that doesn't break your
existing app. Let me explain how it works. First thing, you need to define a function to return a
map of clients:

```ts
function provideClients() {
  return {
    default: defaultClient,
    extra: extraClient
  }
}
```

Then, you can use a new method of ApolloModule called **forRoot** to provide clients, so you can use
it in your app:

```
ApolloModule.forRoot(provideClients)
```

The `Apollo` service has now two new methods: `use()` and `default()`. First one takes a key of a
client you want to use, second one returns the default client.

```typescript

class AppComponent {
  apollo: Apollo;

  ngOnInit() {
    // uses the defaultClient
    this.apollo.watchQuery({...}).subscribe(() => {});

    // works the same as the one above
    this.apollo.default().watchQuery({...}).subscribe(() => {});
    // uses the extraClient
    this.apollo.use('extra').watchQuery({...}).subscribe(() => {});
  }
}

```

> It's important to know that if you want to have a default client, you need to use `default` as a
> key.

## More Control

![](/medium/26d1e2f5199df372a39ca801d9ce936b.png 'We improved integration between frameworks')

Apollo-Client and Apollo-Angular both are written in TypeScript, but we still had room for
improvements for our users, here are some of them.

Thanks to [the recent change](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/914) we were able
to take advantage of TypeScript's feature called **Generic Types**. It's now possible to easily
define an interface of the “data” property in methods like _watchQuery_, _query_, _mutation_ and
many more.

This gives you **more control** over the code, making it **more predictable** and easier to
**prevent bugs.** Take a look at an example.

```ts
const query = gql`
  query currentUser {
    currentUser {
      name
    }
  }
`

interface User {
  name: string
}

interface Data {
  currentUser: User
}

class AppComponent {
  apollo: Apollo
  currentUser: User

  ngOnInit() {
    this.apollo.watchQuery<Data>({ query }).subscribe(result => {
      this.currentUser = result.data.currentUser
    })
  }
}
```

It's very helpful and convenient, especially when used with RxJS operators. You gain more control
over the result modifications. But there are even more improvements!

## Let's Talk about Observables

In Angular world, we commonly use RxJS. Unfortunately, Apollo's standard observable shim is not
compatible with RxJS, so to have the best developer experience, we created the
ApolloQueryObservable. They both behave the same, containing the same methods (like refetch for
example), except the RxJS support.

We recently changed the logic of the ApolloQueryObservable's generic type. Here's an example to see
how to migrate:

```typescript
class AppComponent {
  user: ApolloQueryObservable<ApolloQueryResult<Data>>

  getUser() {
    this.user.subscribe(result => {
      // result is of type ApolloQueryResult<Data>
    })
  }
}
```

```ts
class AppComponent {
  user: ApolloQueryObservable<Data>

  getUser() {
    this.user.subscribe(result => {
      // result is of type ApolloQueryResult<Data>
    })
  }
}
```

## It Is Human Nature to Be Lazy

We love automation, just to avoid keep repeating the same things on and on again. I have great news
for you!

As we know, GraphQL is strongly typed, so we have created a tool to **generate API code or type
annotations based on a GraphQL schema and query documents**. This tool is called
[“apollo-codegen”](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-codegen).

Thanks to Robin Ricard's work, Apollo Codegen now supports TypeScript, so Angular developers no
longer have to define types for their queries manually.

## Better Developer Experience

![](/medium/c6953c9d535f0c4ab8a02f8019954e99.png)

We are happy to announce that Angular integration works great with the
[**Apollo Client Developer Tools**](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/apollo-client-developer-tools-ff89181ebcf).

It's a Chrome DevTools extension for Apollo Client which has 3 main features:

- A built-in GraphiQL console that allows you to make queries against your GraphQL server using your
  app's network interface directly (no configuration necessary).
- A query watcher that shows you which queries are being watched by the current page, when those
  queries are loading, and what variables those queries are using.
- A cache inspector that displays your client-side Redux store in an Apollo-Client-friendly way. You
  can explore the state of the store through a tree-like interface, and search through the store for
  specific field keys and values.

Try the dev tools in your Angular Apollo app today!

## ES6 Modules and Tree Shaking

![](/medium/8356f13d18d0ff7af35920e4bf73f854.png 'UMD bundle and ES6 Modules')

App load time is an important part of the overall user experience. Earlier, I talked about AoT
compilation, which radically improves performance, but there is still room to speed things up.

To make our app even smaller we can use a process called **Tree Shaking**. It basically follows the
trail of import and export statements by statically analyzing the code. This way we get rid of
unused parts of the application.

As you know, every angular package has a **UMD bundle** (to support **CommonJS** and **AMD**) and a
separate space for **ES6 Modules**. Thanks to recent changes in the
[apollo-client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/1069) and
[apollo-client-rxjs](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/apollo-client-rxjs/pull/16), we do the same, so
you can use tree shaking in your app!

## Ready for the Future

![](/medium/250a232da3f4667a2feba74895729d19.png 'Coming out in March 2017')

With the first stable version of Angular, the core team announced a predictable release schedule. It
means that every 6 months there's going to be a new major version of the framework.

We have good news!

**Angular 4.0.0** is now still in beta, but it's **fully compatible with Apollo**, so you don't have
to worry about any breaking changes.

## Keep Improving

We are working hard to give Angular developers the best developer experience we can. We want to hear
more from you — what should we do next, what can we improve?
