## Overview

After a decade of serving the GraphQL open-source community, The Guild has reached another important milestone in our journey. We're proud to announce that we have successfully completed our SOC-2 Type II audit, conducted by [Advantage Partners](https://advantage-partners.com/), using the [Vanta](https://vanta.com/) compliance platform.

As The Guild celebrates its 10th year of operation, this certification marks our transition from a trusted technology provider to an enterprise-ready partner equipped to meet the rigorous security and compliance requirements of organizations of all sizes.

## What is SOC-2 Compliance? Why Type II matters for Enterprises?

[SOC-2](https://www.vanta.com/collection/soc-2/what-is-soc-2) (Service Organization Control 2) is a voluntary compliance standard developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) that specifies how organizations should manage customer data based on five "trust service criteria": security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

While SOC-2 Type I certifications assess whether a company's systems are suitably designed at a specific point in time, **Type II certification** goes much further. It evaluates the operational effectiveness of those controls over a sustained period (in our case, 3 months), providing assurance that a company not only has appropriate security measures in place but consistently follows them.

For enterprises, this distinction is crucial:

1. **Proven Reliability**: Type II demonstrates consistent adherence to security practices over time, not just a one-time assessment
2. **Risk Reduction**: The certification significantly reduces the risk of data breaches and security incidents
3. **Compliance Support**: It helps enterprises meet their own regulatory and internal compliance requirements
4. **Vendor Management**: It simplifies vendor assessment processes, allowing for faster procurement decisions
5. **Trust Verification**: It provides independent verification of security claims by a qualified third party

## What This Means for The Guild Customers

For our customers, this certification brings several tangible benefits:

### Enhanced Security and Privacy

Our SOC-2 Type II certification confirms that we have robust controls in place to protect your data. This includes comprehensive security policies, regular testing, monitoring, and incident response procedures that have been independently verified.

### Simplified Vendor Assessment

For enterprise customers with stringent security requirements, our certification streamlines the procurement process. Instead of conducting extensive security assessments, you can rely on our SOC-2 Type II report as evidence of our security posture.

### Enterprise Readiness

This certification demonstrates that The Guild is an organization that can confidently serve enterprise customers with complex security and compliance requirements, while maintaining technical excellence.
