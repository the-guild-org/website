# Open-Source GraphQL Security, Importance & Tools

Open-source principles have forged GraphQL as a standard, it's ecosystem and community. Bringing
value via transparency and collective knowledge as well as empowering the community with tools and
practices to build better, bigger & more efficient APIs from day to day. Now that GraphQL APIs are
well-established and with a lots of queries on a daily basis, ensuring their security becomes
crucial.

In this exploration, we'll dive into how these open-source practices are important and benefits for
the security of GraphQL and which community tools you can leverage today to secure your APIs.

## GraphQL Is Open-Source at Its Core

The inception and evolution of GraphQL are intrinsically tied to the principles of open-source,
ensuring it flourished not just as a query language but as a community-driven initiative progressing
toward broader, unified API development standards. From its public
[specifiction release](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec) in 2015 by Facebook to its
transition to the [GraphQL Foundation](https://graphql.org/foundation/) in 2018—hosted by the Linux
Foundation—its journey has been transparent and collaborative.

While the GraphQL specification paved the way for consistent and efficient API queries, the
open-source community enhanced this original draft further. Take the
[Relay Pagination Specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm), for instance, which
streamlines how pagination can be handled in GraphQL (among other React specific features),
providing a standard methodology that developers can rely on. Similarly, the introduction of custom
directives allowed GraphQL to become more flexible and adaptable to specific use-cases, like the
[@rest directive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/tools/docs/schema-directives#fetching-data-from-a-rest-api)
or
[@live queries](https://the-guild.dev/blog/subscriptions-and-live-queries-real-time-with-graphql).

Moreover, the vast majority of widespread GraphQL tools have and are being built under open-source
licences. Servers implementations, frontend clients, utilities like schema management, code
generation or even fully fledged API platforms are legion. You can find a comphrensive list of such
tools on the [graphql.org website](https://graphql.org/code/). [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev/)
are also masters when it comes to GrahpQL & Open-source and their tools come highly recommended.

For instance, as GraphQL is transport agnostic, it can be used with any protocol, a tremendous
amount of open-source tools have been built to leverage this flexibility, especially by
[@enisdenjo](https://github.com/enisdenjo): [graphql-http](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-http)
[graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws)
[graphql-sse](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-sse)

I can also mention the work on unified APIs via
[GraphQL federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation) that is also under active
open-source development, with the
[Composite Schema Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/composite-schemas-wg) initiative, and
upcoming
[GraphQL Fusion](https://graphql.org/conf/sessions/4a4e842d1cd0c06083f484d31225abd1/?name=GraphQL%20Fusion:%20Rethinking%20Distributed%20GraphQL)
specification.

And last but not least, the GraphQL community is also very community centered, wether via the
[GraphQL working group](https://graphql.org/community/developers/#working-groups) or the various
events and meetups such as the [GraphQL Conf](https://graphql.org/conf/).

In essence, GraphQL isn't simply open-source in its availability but embodies open-source in its
ongoing development, enhancements, and community engagement, perpetually enriching its ecosystem
with diverse inputs, insights, and innovations.

## The Importance of Open Source and Public Resources in Security

Keeping the internet safe is a big challenge. It's like a tightly connected place with lots of
potential threats. Open source and public tools have been doing a great job at protecting it for
years.

Cybersecurity thrives on collaboration, exemplified by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
([CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/)) system. This public database acts as a central repository for known
cybersecurity threats, allowing for quick dissemination and response. By making vulnerabilities
public, the CVE system ensures timely and widespread implementation of security measures. For
instance, the identification and patching of the Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL was significantly aided
by the CVE system, showcasing its effectiveness in promoting rapid response.

Open source plays a crucial role in cybersecurity by fostering an environment of transparency and
collaboration. It allows for the open identification and resolution of vulnerabilities, benefiting
the entire digital ecosystem. For example, the Linux Kernel, known for its security, continually
improves through community contributions. Similarly, tools like Kali Linux offer insights into
offensive cybersecurity strategies, helping developers strengthen their defenses.

This combination of open source and CVE is especially vital in areas like GraphQL and API security,
providing a foundation for robust, adaptable cybersecurity strategies. Through shared knowledge and
tools, open source and CVE create a proactive defense against evolving cyber threats.

In a field like cybersecurity, where dangers morph quickly, having shared knowledge, united
alertness, and available-to-all tools become an essential shield against potential attacks. The
marriage of open source and cybersecurity offers a lively platform for ongoing learning, changing,
and sharing attack and defense mechanisms, crafting a global, united front against cyber threats.

Moving forward, we'll dive into how this perfect pairing of open source and cybersecurity is
crucial, not just relevant, for GraphQL and API security. We'll highlight practical tools and
strategies you can use today to protect your applications.
