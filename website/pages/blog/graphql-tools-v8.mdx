Ever since [The Guild has taken over GraphQL Tools](/blog/graphql-tools-v6), we kept our promise and
like every open source library we maintain,
[we keep improving and supporting](/blog/tag/graphql-tools) it on a daily basis.

Many things are continuously happening and improving with the library, and now, as we are releasing
a new major version, we wanted to share some new things we've added.

It's important for us to say thank you to all our users and open source contributors. The driving
force behind this tremendous amount of work is you!

TL;DR

- We significantly improved GraphQL Stitching Performance
- You can now manage [GraphQL federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation) services
  using Schema Stitching Gateway
- You can consume Relay services in the Gateway
- We support upcoming graphql-js features like `@defer` and `@stream`
- Many more improvements in the release notes

## Faster Schema Stitching

We heavily worked on improving the performance of Schema Stitching by refactoring some parts of the
query planner, schema delegation and more. So we got much better performance than before. Please
check the release notes to make sure you are good to start using v8 to benefit from all these
improvements!

## More Flexible Schema Stitching

The modern Schema Stitching is fairly comparable to Apollo Federation with automated query planning,
merged types, and declarative schema directives.

But it is also more configurable. You can configure your gateway and services in service level using
Stitching Directives or in the gateway level using Type Merging configuration.

### Manage Apollo Federation Services with Schema Stitching Gateway

You can even consume your existing Apollo Federation services inside Schema Stitching without any
changes by using the `federationToStitchingSDL` utility function from
`@graphql-tools/stitching-directives`. Please check the Stitching Handbook to learn more.

[Federation Services - Stitching Handbook](https://github.com/gmac/schema-stitching-handbook/tree/master/federation-services)

### Relay-Based Gateway Possible?

If you have multiple services using
[Relay Specification](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/graphql-server-specification/#schema), you can
easily combine them with the `handleRelaySubschemas` utility function from `@graphql-tools/stitch`
package, and your unified schema will handle `Node` interface and `node` operation automatically
using Type Merging.

[You can check the unit tests to see the complete usage](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools/blob/master/packages/stitch/tests/relay.spec.ts)

It is pretty new, and we will improve the documentation for this use case gradually.

### What Is Type Merging?

Type merging allows partial definitions of a type to exist in any subschema, all of which are merged
into one unified type in the gateway schema. When querying for a merged type, the gateway smartly
delegates portions of a request to each relevant subschema in dependency order, and then combines
all results for the final return.

Type merging is now the preferred method of including GraphQL types across subschemas, replacing the
need for schema extensions (though does not preclude their use). To migrate from schema extensions,
simply enable type merging and then start replacing extensions one by one with merges.

### Future-Proof Schema Delegation

GraphQL Tools v8 is getting prepared for incoming GraphQL-js features. With defer and stream,
GraphQL execution will return Async Iterables even for `query` and `mutation` operations like
`subscription` ones. So we decided to remove `Subscriber` because we will need to handle Async
Iterables in `Executor` eventually.

You can easily merge your existing `Executor` and `Subscriber` functions by checking the
`operationType` of `ExecutionParams`;

```ts
function myExecutor({ document, variables, operationType }) {
  if (operationType === 'subscription') {
    return callWSClient(...);
  }
  return callHTTPClient(...);
}
```

### Create `GraphQLSchema` Instances for Your Remote APIs

URL Loader from `@graphql-tools/url-loader` package creates executable GraphQLSchema instances for
you to call your remote GraphQL APIs by using different protocols;

- Server Sent Events ✔️
- New [GraphQL-WS](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws) ✔️
- Legacy subscriptions-transport-ws ✔️
- [Multipart File Uploads](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) ✔️

```ts
import { loadSchema } from '@graphql-tools/load'
import { UrlLoader } from '@graphql-tools/url-loader'

const schema = await loadSchema(`https://my-graphql-api.com`, {
  loaders: [new UrlLoader()],
  // Enable File Uploads
  multipart: true,
  // Choose your Subscription protocol
  subscriptionProtocol: SubscriptionProtocol.SSE
})
```

#### Create Executors for Schema Stitching / Delegation

You can easily create executors for subschemas like below:

```ts
import { stitchSchemas } from '@graphql-tools/stitch'
import { UrlLoader } from '@graphql-tools/url-loader'
import { introspectSchema } from '@graphql-tools/wrap'

const urlLoader = new UrlLoader()
const executor = urlLoader.getExecutorAsync(`https://my-graphql-api.com`, {})

const mySubschema = {
  schema: await introspectSchema(executor),
  executor
}

const stitchedSchema = await stitchSchemas([mySubschema, myOtherSubschema])
```

## And More...

- Git Loader now supports glob patterns
  - GraphQL Tools is used by GraphQL Config, GraphQL Code Generator, GraphQL Inspector and more to
    download the type definitions and operation documents from the different sources with GraphQL
    Tools Loaders.
  - For example to compare your schema against the master, you need to dump your schema into a
    single “schema.graphql” file and point the GraphQL Inspector to that file. But now you can use
    glob patterns to point multiple files on your Git repo, and you don't need to have a generated
    `schema.graphql` in the codebase.
- No more a huge `graphql-tools` package;
  - GraphQL Tools has a lot of packages for different use cases and previously we were publishing
    `graphql-tools` package to the npm that includes all scoped packages we have in the repo. Let's
    say when someone only needs `makeExecutableSchema`, NPM installs every single package with a lot
    of unused dependencies together with those. From now on, we decided to deprecate `graphql-tools`
    and encourage the users to migrate to the scoped packages. For example, you should install
    `@graphql-tools/schema` for `makeExecutableSchema`. You can check API Reference and the rest of
    the documentation to find what packages you need.
- We have removed some functions, methods and stuff that are not widely used by the community;
  - `makeRemoteExecutableSchema`
    - In the new GraphQL Tools, you don't need this at all. You can write your own executor by
      following the documentation and use wrapSchema instead. Or you can use UrlLoader directly
      without the need of writing all the remote execution logic.
    - This was already being deprecated after v4 in favor of `wrapSchema`.
      [You can find the new usage in the docs.](https://graphql-tools.com/docs/stitch-combining-schemas#stitching-remote-schemas)
  - Legacy Schema Directives, `visitSchema` and `directiveResolvers`
    - We suggest you to
      [check the new approach for schema directives and schema visiting in the documentation instead of these old approaches.](https://graphql-tools.com/docs/schema-directives#full-mapschema-api)
  - And there are some other utility functions you might have been using from GraphQL Tools. You can
    check CHANGELOG to see rest of them.
