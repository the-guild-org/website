The latest version [v0.2.0 of `@graphql-yoga/nestjs`](https://github.com/charlypoly/graphql-yoga-nestjs/releases/tag/v0.2.0), the NestJS GraphQL Yoga driver, added support for NestJS v9.

## NestJS V9

Just recently, NestJS, a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications, has released a new version v9. Fixes and improvements are encompasing the complete framework, be sure to do an update!

Read more about the new release on the ["NestJS v9 is now available!" announcement](https://trilon.io/blog/nestjs-9-is-now-available).

### NestJS V8 Still Supported

Even with the added v9 support, v8 will still be supported. You do not have to make any adjustments to your code.

### Migrating from NestJS V8

We recommend you consult the great [Migration guide from NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/migration-guide) for migrating NestJS itself and simply doing an update to [v0.2.0 of `@graphql-yoga/nestjs`](https://github.com/charlypoly/graphql-yoga-nestjs/releases/tag/v0.2.0).
