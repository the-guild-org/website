The latest version
[v0.2.0 of `@graphql-yoga/nestjs`](https://github.com/charlypoly/graphql-yoga-nestjs/releases/tag/v0.2.0),
the NestJS GraphQL Yoga driver, added support for NestJS v9.

That also includes updating GraphQL Yoga to the latest
[v3 release with all its new features](/blog/graphql-yoga-v3)!

## NestJS V9

Just recently, NestJS, a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side
applications, has released a new version v9. Fixes and improvements are encompasing the complete
framework, be sure to do an update!

Read more about the new release on the
["NestJS v9 is now available!" announcement](https://trilon.io/blog/nestjs-9-is-now-available).

### NestJS V8 Still Supported

Even with the added v9 support, v8 will still be supported. You do not have to make any adjustments
to your code.

### Migrating from NestJS V8

We recommend you consult the great
[Migration guide from NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/migration-guide) for migrating NestJS itself
and simply doing an update to
[v0.2.0 of `@graphql-yoga/nestjs`](https://github.com/charlypoly/graphql-yoga-nestjs/releases/tag/v0.2.0).

We love supporting our NestJS users and the NestJS community as a whole. We see more and more NestJS
developers migrating to Yoga, the best and most feature rich GraphQL server out there.

Please try it out, share with us your feedback and let us know how we can make NestJS developers
lives better!
