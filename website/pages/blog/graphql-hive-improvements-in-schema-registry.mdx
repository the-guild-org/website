We are excited to announce the implementation of a new and improved schema registry model. This new
model is designed to provide you with a **more optimized workflow** and an **improved user
experience**.

It is important to note that access to **the old schema registry model will be discontinued in a few
months' time**. We strongly recommend that you switch to the modern model as soon as possible to
take advantage of its many benefits.

<Callout type="info">The steps to switch can be found in the settings of your project.</Callout>

In comparison to the old model, the new model has superior defaults, follows best practices, and has
a streamlined workflow. A comparison table available in the settings of your projects will help you
understand the differences between the two models.

One of the most notable improvements in the new model is the **availability of the delete feature**.
With the modern model, you can now delete a schema from the registry with ease. This is a feature
that was not available in the old model.

In conclusion, we are confident that the new schema registry model will provide you with a more
efficient and effective workflow. If you have any questions or concerns about the transition, please
do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to assist you every step of the way.
