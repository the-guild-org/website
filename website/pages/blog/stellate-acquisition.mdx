Today we are very pleased to announce that we have acquired
[Stellate](https://stellate.co/?utm_source=theguild&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=announcement)
GraphQL CDN - the leading GraphQL Caching solution.

The Stellate team has created an innovative platform, industry leading solution for GraphQL Caching,
fulfilling GraphQL's full potential for caching, enabling its superiority over all REST based
caching solutions.

The Guild's [goal](https://the-guild.dev/about-us) - providing an open platform with everything a
developer needs to take GraphQL into production, fits perfectly with Stellate's superb execution.

That's why acquiring Stellate and integrating it into our
[GraphQL Hive Open Platform](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) makes so much sense.

We've always prided ourselves on being the provider the GraphQL community can count on for the long
term.  
In the past, we've taken maintainership of a number of popular solutions, to give them new life and
improve them to the be industry leading solutions:

- We've [taken ownership](https://the-guild.dev/blog/graphql-tools-v6) of the famous GraphQL Tools
  library from Apollo - improving it for many years and recently integrating it into our
  [Hive Gateway](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway) - our open source gateway that
  fully supports [Apollo Federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation).
- We've [taken ownership](https://the-guild.dev/blog/announcing-graphql-yoga-v2) of GraphQL Yoga
  from Prisma - making it the [leading](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/comparison)
  Subgraph and GraphQL server for the JS ecosystem.
- We've done the same with
  [many other libraries](https://www.prisma.io/blog/the-guild-takes-over-oss-libraries-vvluy2i4uevs)
  and continuously support official GraphQL Foundation projects like
  [GraphiQL](https://graphql.org/conf/2023/sessions/e0985f6bdb4bbf07a5ca5ba72fbcc39c/),
  [GraphQL-HTTP](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-http#graphql-http),
  [GraphQL's official website](https://graphql.org/blog/2024-06-11-announcing-new-graphql-website/)
  and many more.

We offer GraphQL Hive to our users - a fully featured, complete 360˚ GraphQL platform that includes
a schema registry, analytics platform, Federated Gateway - available either as a hosted platform or
as a fully open-source, self-hosted solution under the
[MIT license](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/blob/main/LICENSE).

And now with an industry leading global GraphQL Edge Caching CDN!

Like all of our other projects, this is just the start! We are looking to hear from you, where you
wish us to take Stellate and our platform in the future.
