Building GraphQL servers in 2022 couldn't be any easier thanks to GraphQL Yoga. This year at
[HasuraCon](https://hasura.io/events/hasura-con-2022/building-graphql-servers-in-2022-overview-of-the-bestnew-tools-you-should-add-to-your-toolbelt)
I discussed how Yoga started, how it evolved, and what we can expect from the future.

For many years of building GraphQL servers in the Node ecosystem, our choices have been limited.
Apollo Server library has dominated the ecosystem. With its pairing client library, it was often a
good fit for a very long time. However, I believe there are more mature and battle-tested solutions
available today, thanks to the evolution of Yoga.

[GraphQL Yoga](https://graphql-yoga.com) takes a different approach by providing enough bells and
whistles that make you production-ready, but builds itself on top of the core primitives of HTTP.
Yoga is runtime agnostic too, so if you're currently working with Cloudflare Workers, Vercel
Functions, AWS Lambda or something else, Yoga will fit right in.

GraphQL Yoga comes with [Envelop](https://envelop.dev), and is the recommended way you should be
using Envelop today to extend your GraphQL server.

If you haven't used Yoga before, this is how easy it is to create a production-ready GraphQL server:

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

const server = createServer({
  schema: {
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        hello: () => 'Hello from Yoga!'
      }
    }
  }
})

server.start()
```

Hopefully you find this talk interesting, and you learn more about building GraphQL severs with
Yoga!
