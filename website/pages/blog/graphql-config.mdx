## TL;DR

- Visit our website **[graphql-config.com](https://graphql-config.com)**
- [**GraphQL Config**](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-config) is **one** simple place to
  store **all** your GraphQL Configurations for **any** GraphQL based tool
- [Prisma recently transferred the project](https://prisma.io/blog/the-guild-takes-over-oss-libraries-vvluy2i4uevs)
  to [The Guild](/) — and we **completely rewrote it** and addressed **more than ⅔ of the issues**
  (and the remaining are waiting for feedback)
- We've already **merged configurations** from [GCG](https://graphql-code-generator.com),
  [GraphQL Inspector](https://graphql-inspector.com),
  [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-cli) — and are looking to learn and **integrate**
  with GraphiQL, AppSync, Apollo, Gatsby, VS-Code extensions, Relay and the GraphQL team at Facebook
  and any GraphQL tool creators
- This is an **alpha phase** — **we want your feedback**, as a user and as a creator — Please
  [**create an issue**](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-config) or
  [**join our Discord channel**](https://discord.gg/xud7bH9)

## How Did We Get Here?

About 2 years ago Prisma came up with a great idea for the GraphQL community — Why repeat yourself
in creating your configuration for each tool you use in your application.

So together with many developers from the GraphQL community,
[they introduced the GraphQL Config library and spec](https://prisma.io/blog/new-tooling-to-improve-your-graphql-workflows-7240c81e1ba3)
and many tools have since embraced that standard.

But time has passed and the library slowly became unmaintained.

Prisma were very kind and generous with moving the project forward and
[passing it to us](https://prisma.io/blog/the-guild-takes-over-oss-libraries-vvluy2i4uevs).

So when we took over the GraphQL Config, our main goal was to bring it back to life and push it
forward for the community.

We asked for feedback, looked at existing and new tools that came out since it was released, went
through all the open issues and PRs, listened to your suggestions and got to work!

---

## Our Main Goals Are

- Highly **customizable** and **extensible**
- More **useful** structure
- **Flexible** and helpful enough to become a standard in the community
- Make it **platform-agnostic** (Node, Browser)

---

## Try It Out Today

We've already refactored most of the code, created a new structure, referenced all the related
issues and released a new alpha version:

```sh
npm install graphql-config@next
```

```sh
yarn add graphql-config@next
```

Now we want to hear from you — GraphQL developers and GraphQL tool creators.

Here is a deeper dive into what we've done:

---

## Different Formats of GraphQL Config File

The new [GraphQL Config](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-config) now allows to use JSON,
YAML and JavaScript.

## GraphQL Config Looks for:

- `.graphqlrc`
- `.graphqlrc.yaml`
- `.graphqlrc.yml`
- `.graphqlrc.json`
- `.graphqlrc.js`
- `graphql.config.js`

The new config can also be created programmatically too.

It also accepts a config defined under `graphql` property in your `package.json` file.

> We're open to expand the range of file names and looking forward to hear more of your use cases.

## New Structure

GraphQL Config allowed to indicate a single graphql file, an introspection file or a URL to an
endpoint. That's the past!

```yaml
schema: './schema.graphql'
documents: './my/app/**/*.graphql'
extensions:
  customConfig:
    value: true
```

## Schema

We've decided to expand [GraphQL Config](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-config) for variety
of sources of GraphQL Schema and rename `schemaPath` to just `schema`.

It accepts now not only a single file but also a glob pattern to match your modularized schema.

## Allows to Generate Schema from:

- files matching a glob pattern (or a list of patterns)
- an explicit list of files
- an endpoint
- an introspection file
- **TypeScript and JavaScript files**
- and even more…

It was possible thanks to the concept of **Loaders** which we'll talk about later in the article.

## Documents

Majority of the GraphQL tools depend not only on Schema but Operations and Fragments, so we've
decided to cover that use case too.

> With the new GraphQL Config, you're able to indicate files containing GraphQL operations and
> fragments (documents) and load them all within a single method.

GraphQL Config accepts not only `.graphql` files but also extracts documents from **TypeScript and
JavaScript files, including JSX and TSX**.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import gql from 'graphql-tag'
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/react-hooks'

// GraphQL Config is able to extract it!
const GET_USERS = gql`
  {
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`

export function Users() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_USERS)

  // ...

  return <UsersList users={data.users} />
}
```

Thanks to that, you can still write your operations and fragments with `graphql-tag` and put them in
your React components. GraphQL Config is smart enough to find and collect them.

## Include and Exclude

`Include` and `Exclude` options are still relevant, but we improved and fixed the logic behind them.

> Their purpose is to tell config's consumer which files belongs to what project.

Files covered by schema or documents options are automatically included, there's no need to include
them twice.

## Extensions

We also kept `extensions` and turned them into a first class citizen in GraphQL Config, **making
them way more powerful than before**.

```yaml
schema: './schema/*.graphql'
extensions:
  codegen:
    generates:
      ./src/types.ts:
        plugins:
          - typescript
          - typescript-resolvers
```

## Pluggable Loaders

The source of GraphQL Schema may differ, depending on the setup. In some projects SDL is kept within
graphql files, others store it in code.

**The new GraphQL Config is capable of loading schema from:**

- `.graphql` files
- introspection result file
- running endpoints
- Files on **GitHub**
- Files on **Git repository**
- files with documents wrapped with `graphql-tag`and gatsby's `graphql`
- documents with the magic comment `/* GraphQL */`
- single **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** file that exports GraphQLSchema object, DocumentNode or
  schema as string

**The possibilities are endless here!**

> The main idea behind loaders is to extend the default behavior of GraphQL Config and allow to load
> GraphQL Schema from many different sources.

Loaders are flexible enough to let you decide what exactly you want to use, even just to keep the
bundle size smaller.

It also simplifies the codebase of GraphQL tools as they don't need to take care of that work
themselves anymore.

```typescript
export const RelayLoader = {
  loaderId() {
    return 'relay-loader'
  },
  canLoad(pointer) {
    return isReactFile(pointer)
  },
  load(pointer) {
    const document = extractDocument(pointer)

    return new Source({
      location: pointer,
      document
    })
  }
}
```

We maintain
[a few loaders](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-toolkit/tree/master/packages/loaders), but we
believe the community will start to cover other use cases as well.

## All Platforms

Our goal is to make **GraphQL Config platform-agnostic**.

The old version relied heavily on Node's file system, which is a blocker in many cases.

**Loader fits here perfectly.**

Because it's just an asynchronous function that receives an input and gives back a GraphQL Schema,
it should work fine in browser and in any other environment.

## Extensions

In the previous generation of GraphQL Config `extensions` namespace, there was a way to pass custom
information to the consumers of the config file, like libraries and IDE extensions.

We believe `extensions` should actually **extend** GraphQL Config's behavior.

Take for example loaders. Imagine you want to collect operations and fragments from your Relay
project. With the new GraphQL Config, you can write a loader and register it through a Relay
Extension.

```typescript
const RelayExtension = api => {
  api.loaders.documents.register(RelayLoader)

  return {
    name: 'relay'
  }
}
```

The new `extensions` allows you to turn GraphQL Config into something fully customizable and to be
used in tools like Webpack!

## Hooks

We believe that there's a need to **intercept the schema building process** or to simply **validate
the config**.

It's not currently available but with your help and suggestions we could make it happen.

## Environment Variables

In the new GraphQL Config, we've decided to support environment variables. **It was a long time
hanging and highly requested issue**. Now the usage in JS config file is straightforward. It's also
very easy to use environment variables in YAML and JSON files.

```yaml
schema: './schema.graphql'
include: ${INCLUDE_GLOB}
```

Every `${ENV_VAR}` in the config file is replaced with the actual value. We also allow for defaults.
Using `${ENV_VAR:foo}` results in `foo`.

## Easier to Contribute

We also wanted to make the codebase itself easy to understand and contribute to.

Our first task was to **bring the repository back to life** by updating the build and test setup.

The `graphql-config` package now ships with **CommonJS** and **ES Modules** thanks to **Rollup** and
**TypeScript**. Tests are done thanks to **Jest**. The codebase stays consistent because of
**Prettier** and **ESLint** on top.

We also migrated from Travis to **GitHub Actions** and run tests on **Node 8, 10 and 12**.

To keep dependencies always up to date and to make sure no new release breaks GraphQL Config's
logic, we decided to use **Dependabot**.

We also addressed more than 70% of the issues and open PRs (and the remaining are waiting for
feedback).
