## GraphQL over WebSockets

## Introduction

At some point in time during your web development journeys, you may've been faced with the challenge
to add a real-time component. The synonym for realtime in the browser is the WebSocket API.
[This is how MDN's describes it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API):

> The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive
> communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send
> messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a
> reply.

Google Chrome was the first browser to support the WebSocket Protocol, adding support in 2009 - two
years before it was officially standardised in 2011. As the need for full-duplex server-client
communications rose, other browsers followed suit.

As of today, all major browsers support the WebSocket Protocol - see the
[Can I Use table](https://caniuse.com/?search=Web%20Sockets).

## WebSockets ❤️ GraphQL

Okay, so, how do I use WebSockets to add support for the
[GraphQL `subscription` operation](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Subscription)? Doing a
basic Google search, you'd be faced with a single solution, namely
[`subscriptions-transport-ws`](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws). Looking
through the repository, checking recent comments, reading through the issues and open PRs - might
have you notice the abundance of bugs and their security implications.
[A summary can be found here](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/issues/3).

The authors have done a brilliant job, but unfortunately other projects and needs have reduced their
disposable time for maintaining and nurturing this well accomplished, yet needy, idea. But, it did
indeed inspire me to take up their legacy and revitalised it! Having faced various WebSocket
challenges with GraphQL myself - I jumped in writing a new library from scratch.

With no further ado - I humbly introduce [`graphql-ws`](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws). A
coherent, feature-full, zero-dependency, plug-n-play, lazy, simple, server and client implementation
of the
[new, security first GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)
with full support for all 3 GraphQL operations: `Queries`, `Mutations` and `Subscriptions`. The
protocol aims to be standardised and become a part of GraphQL with the help of the foundation's
[GraphQL over HTTP work group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/140).

The library is written in TypeScript and the full implementation totals merely ~1000 lines of well
formatted, commented, code. It leverages modern JavaScript primitives and the well established
presence of WebSockets.

## How Do I Get Started?

I am glad you asked! This is how:

#### Install

```sh
yarn add graphql-ws
```

#### Create a GraphQL Schema

```ts
import { buildSchema } from 'graphql'

// Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language
const schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
  type Subscription {
    greetings: String
  }
`)

// The roots provide resolvers for each GraphQL operation
const roots = {
  query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello World!'
  },
  subscription: {
    greetings: async function* sayHiIn5Languages() {
      for (const hi of ['Hi', 'Bonjour', 'Hola', 'Ciao', 'Zdravo']) {
        yield { greetings: hi }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Start the Server

##### With [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws)

```ts
import { useServer } from 'graphql-ws/lib/use/ws'
// yarn add ws
import ws from 'ws'

const server = new ws.Server({
  port: 4000,
  path: '/graphql'
})

useServer(
  // from the previous step
  { schema, roots },
  server
)

console.log('Listening to port 4000')
```

##### With [`uWebSockets.js`](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js)

```ts
import { makeBehavior } from 'graphql-ws/lib/use/uWebSockets'
// yarn add uWebSockets.js@uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#<tag>
import uWS from 'uWebSockets.js'

uWS
  .App()
  .ws(
    '/graphql',
    makeBehavior(
      // from the previous step
      { schema, roots }
    )
  )
  .listen(4000, listenSocket => {
    if (listenSocket) {
      console.log('Listening to port 4000')
    }
  })
```

##### With [`fastify-websocket`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-websocket)

```ts
// yarn add fastify
import Fastify from 'fastify'
// yarn add fastify-websocket
import fastifyWebsocket from 'fastify-websocket'
import { makeHandler } from 'graphql-ws/lib/use/fastify-websocket'

const fastify = Fastify()
fastify.register(fastifyWebsocket)

fastify.get(
  '/graphql',
  { websocket: true },
  makeHandler(
    // from the previous step
    { schema, roots }
  )
)

fastify.listen(4000, err => {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err)
    return process.exit(1)
  }
  console.log('Listening to port 4000')
})
```

#### Use the Client

```ts
import { createClient } from 'graphql-ws'

const client = createClient({
  url: 'ws://welcomer.com:4000/graphql'
})

// query
;(async () => {
  const result = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let result
    client.subscribe(
      {
        query: '{ hello }'
      },
      {
        next: data => (result = data),
        error: reject,
        complete: () => resolve(result)
      }
    )
  })

  expect(result).toEqual({ hello: 'Hello World!' })
})()

// subscription
;(async () => {
  const onNext = () => {
    /* handle incoming values */
  }

  let unsubscribe = () => {
    /* complete the subscription */
  }

  await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    unsubscribe = client.subscribe(
      {
        query: 'subscription { greetings }'
      },
      {
        next: onNext,
        error: reject,
        complete: resolve
      }
    )
  })

  expect(onNext).toBeCalledTimes(5) // we say "Hi" in 5 languages
})()
```
