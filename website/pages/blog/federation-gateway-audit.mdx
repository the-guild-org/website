The Apollo Federation spec is a hot topic, we must admit. The adoption of it keeps increasing,
especially over past two years. There's a reason! It's a fantastic piece of technology, but also a
complex piece of tech.

## Complexity Is Not Obvious{/* eslint-disable-line mdx/remark */}

**As a user** of Apollo Federation, you might not see the full spectrum of
[Apollo Federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation).

When building subgraphs, you might occasionally encounter composition errors, but ultimately,
everything works and you query data. The real complexity lies in tooling, starting with the
composition library, and ending on the gateway and it's query planning.

**As maintainers** of [Hive Gateway](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway)
([previously part of GraphQL Mesh](/blog/graphql-mesh-v1-hive-gateway-v1)) and creators of GraphQL
Hive (our Schema Registry for GraphQL Federation), we've seen a wide range of supergraphs. Over the
past few years, we've been working with companies adopting or already using Apollo Federation in
production.

We learned something, actually quite a lot!

Today, we're even collaborating with creators of Apollo Federation and the
[ChilliCream](https://chillicream.com/) teams (who built
[GraphQL Fusion](https://chillicream.com/blog/2023/08/15/graphql-fusion/)) on
[the new specification for federated GraphQL APIs](https://graphql.org/blog/2024-05-16-composite-schemas-announcement/),
as proud members of GraphQL Foundation.

We've seen Apollo Federation's complexity, we understood the rules of it very well, and we have
something incredibly interesting to share!

Before we get to that, let's first discuss what does it mean to "support Apollo Federation" on a
gateway.

## What Does "Apollo Federation Support" Really Mean?{/* eslint-disable-line mdx/remark */}

As you know, the spec contains a lot of directives, and these can be used in various ways, resulting
in **many** combinations. Sometimes weird at first glance, but when you really think about them,
they make sense.

In a lot of cases, the spec is abused, but hey… what's allowed, has to work!

Most of the time you will see “Apollo Federation support” phrase or a list of supported directives,
and this is fine, but it tells only a part of the story.

If a gateway supports the `@key` directive, it may or may not support it on an Interface type, for
example. You simply don't know until you try it!

Did you know that in Apollo Federation v1, a field that is annotated with `@external`, that is also
part of key fields, and is not defined anywhere else, is still resolvable?

```graphql
extend type Product @key(fields: "id name") @key(fields: "upc") {
  id: ID @external
  name: String @external
  upc: String @external
  price: Float!
}
```

Not everyone knows that key fields of extension types in Federation v1, must be annotated with
@external , and these are still resolvable by the subgraph. That's why we built the audit!

## The Apollo Federation Audit!{/* eslint-disable-line mdx/remark */}

As you know, The Guild has open source nature in its core. What we do we share, we open source, we
give away for free. It was always like that, it won't ever change.

Over the years we encountered a lot of aspects of Apollo Federation when working on query planning
for Hive Gateway (previously GraphQL Mesh, just a reminder that it's not a new project, but rather
well established).

We spent quite a few months, writing down our knowledge about Apollo Federation, in form of 40
supergraphs, covering wide range, if not all, of the spec.

Each of those supergraphs, have a set of subgraphs running as real GraphQL APIs, with real runtime
and real data.

We have created 170 tests in total so far…

All that effort to measure how compatible our gateway is with Apollo Federation... and now we give
it away to everyone, even our “competitors”, for free, no strings attached!

> We never had a tool to measure gateway's compatibility with Apollo Federation, but now we have one
> — and we've put it to the test!

Visit the audit page and see the results:

The main reason behind building such tool, was to improve our Hive Gateway, have a set of tests we
can use for various of ways. We were also curious how well the rest of the GraphQL gateways perform,
how compatible they are, how good their query planning understands Apollo Federation. The results
are interesting.

## About the Audit{/* eslint-disable-line mdx/remark */}

The existing GraphQL Gateway benchmarks focus on performance, pure speed, query planning overhead
and related factors. You only care about performance, if the gateway can query data correctly. Who
wants a fast, but partially broken gateway? All the gateway implementors knows that, and they work
hard to improve their gateway every day.

We wanted to push the community forward, by giving them a chance to make a giant jump.

That's why the auditing tool is fully open-source (MIT license), and available for everyone.

Visit the repository:
[https://github.com/the-guild-org/graphql-federation-gateway-audit](https://github.com/the-guild-org/graphql-federation-gateway-audit)

We want to turn our effort into helping potential users of GraphQL gateways to better understand
what Apollo Federation support means, but also the maintainers of those gateways to improve their
score and learn from our experience.

We aim to make it a shared effort, an "official" auditing tool for Apollo Federation gateways.
