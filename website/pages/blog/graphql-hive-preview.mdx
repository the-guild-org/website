Today, we're happy to announce
[**GraphQL Hive**](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=blog_hive) -
**a registry of schemas** to manage, safeguard and optimize your **team's workflows** when deploying
**GraphQL services**. Hold your horses, we're not publicly launching it yet, it's only the start of
a beta testing program we give out today. **Sign up for early access!**

## Short Introduction

GraphQL Hive is a registry of schemas with many additional features to enhance your day-to-day work
with GraphQL.

We think of GraphQL Hive as a beehive where instead of honey, GraphQL Schemas are being managed and
produced.

GraphQL Hive will be released in two forms: An **open-source** collaboration tool and a **hosted and
managed service**. That is in order we can support any type of GraphQL workflow, including custom
workflows and on-premise needs.

> Also, just like the bees, we're continuously working hard (or hardly working) to ship new
> features.

## All Schemas

[GraphQL Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) **supports regular GraphQL,
[Apollo Federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation) and Schema Stitching services**.
In a later release we also aim to support other types of schemas, like open-api, gRPC, SOAP and
others that are not originally GraphQL thanks to the power of our
[GraphQL Mesh library](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive). That is in order that you will be able
to enjoy all the powerful features from GraphQL Hive, even if you don't use GraphQL.

## Registry but Not Only

Our roadmap includes monitoring, safe-listing of operations, breaking change detection, changelogs
and many others. Our next task on the list is to support persisted queries for most GraphQL clients.
Let us know what you wish to see in GraphQL Hive!

All of that to get a clear picture of how the GraphQL APIs are being developed and consumed.
