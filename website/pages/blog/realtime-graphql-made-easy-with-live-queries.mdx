The Guild has made working with realtime [GraphQL Subscriptions and Live Queries](/blog/subscriptions-and-live-queries-real-time-with-graphql) easy over the last few years thanks to plugins that work out of the box with GraphQL Yoga.

However, there are developers who don't want the hassle of building a backend, managing deployments, configuring continuous integration, juggling connection pooling, and more. Thankfully there are solutions which are designed to abstract all of that hard work &mdash; AWS Amplify, Grafbase, etc.

Grafbase was designed to manage all of the above. You get the power of a fully distributed GraphQL API at the edge all by creating a single `grafbase/schema.graphql` file in your project.

Your schema contains models with special directives to relate data, set default values, validation, and more.

```graphql
# grafbase/schema.graphql

type Post @model {
  title: String!
  slug: String! @unique
}
```

[Laurin Quast](https://twitter.com/n1rual) introduced in 2021 a collection of packages to support the use of GraphQL Live Queries in the server, and client.

**Today, [Grafbase](https://grafbase.com) is happy to announce it now supports GraphQL Live Queries!**

This means that all you need to do to start using GraphQL Live Queries is add `@live` to your query!

```graphql
query @live {
  postCollection(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Together with The Guild, Grafbase is also releasing 2 new packages (with more on the way) to further abstract the effort needed to implement Live Queries on the frontend.

Starting with support for [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/), you can add Live Queries with the following packages:

- [`@grafbase/apollo-link`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grafbase/apollo-link)
- [`@grafbase/urql-exchange`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grafbase/urql-exchange)

Both packages use the foundations set by The Guild to handle [Server-Sent Events](https://grafbase.com/docs/realtime/live-queries#server-sent-events), and [JSON Patch](https://grafbase.com/docs/realtime/live-queries#json-patch).

## Try it now!

You can try Live Queries by building your own backend in one simple command:

```bash
npx grafbase init
```

Once you've modelled your data using the [schema](https://grafbase.com/docs/schema/overview) you can run your backend locally to build:

```bash
npx grafbase dev
```
