## What Was the Problem and the Existing Solutions?

I was working on a project that has RN frontend and Meteor backend, but uses
[`react-native-meteor`](https://github.com/inProgress-team/react-native-meteor) npm package in RN
project. I couldn't share any code between them without struggling aliasing module import names and
the other stuff.

I wanted to share the code between client and server like many Meteor projects do, because I was
working on backend with a React Native developer who hadn't know Meteor a lot. And, my TypeScript
code will help him to write less error-prone code with type-checking feature of VSCode.

Then, I searched on Google for any alternative that makes the code sharing
available.`react-native-meteor` package is quite useful, but is not able to share the code between
client and server which Meteor does for Web.

I found a pretty old alternative called
[`meteor-native-packages`](https://github.com/Urigo/meteor-native-packages) . It is a set of
modified core packages of Meteor that replaces Browser API codes with React Native and NodeJS
compatible ones . This idea makes Meteor Client work when they are bundled via
`meteor-client-bundler`. However, all these need to be synced with Meteor's native API which is
really hard to maintain.

Also, we have another problem; older `meteor-client-bundler` versions haven't supported use of
external node modules in the client project's `node_modules`.

To summarize, there were various libraries and 3rd party solutions to connect React Native to Meteor
such as `react-native-meteor` and `meteor-native-packages` with the challenge in
`meteor-client-bundler` .

## Solution: Browser Polyfills for Official Meteor Client

I've published a different package
[`react-native-browser-polyfills`](https://github.com/ardatan/react-native-browser-polyfills) that
shims necessary APIs of browser to make Meteor's official client compatible with React Native that
is bundled by `meteor-client-bundler` .

I also added some features such as generating stub modules in `node_modules` directory to make
`meteor/PACKAGE_NAME` syntax available, and support the use of external npm dependencies in the
client project's `node_modules` directory for the official `meteor/react-meteor-data` package
instead of using the replication version in npm which has the same name. You can see more on the
related post about MCB;

As you know, Meteor has SockJS built-in which is compatible with both browser and NodeJS. So, the
only problem is the code that uses DOM API. Luckily, _WebSocket_ has already been implemented by
React Native. There is another savior for the rest.

`react-native-browser-polyfills` has been just released for polyfill DOM API including
`localStorage` , `navigator.connection` , `document.location` and some other subsets that uses React
Native API equivalent ones.

`AsyncStorage` is used for `localStorage` , `NetInfo` is used for `navigator.connection` and
`Linking` is used for `document.location` . But, the problem is that these APIs from React Native
are asynchronous while they are synchronous in browser. As a workaround,
`react-native-browser-polyfills` waits for resolving their promises, then emits `DOMContentsLoaded`
for `document` which Meteor Client would be waiting for in order to initiate the connection between
RN and Meteor backend.

## Also, We Have Facebook, Twitter and Google Login on React Native and Meteor Stack

This was the most challenging one which is solved by another package
[`react-native-meteor-polyfills`](https://github.com/ardatan/react-native-meteor-polyfills) that
extends `react-native-browser-polyfills` .

I've released another package `react-native-meteor-polyfills` to polyfill `window.open` with
`Linking` by extending `react-native-browser-polyfills`. However, this polyfill must be included to
Meteor project as well to make it able to redirect to the RN app after a successful OAuth login.

Thanks to this polyfill, you can use `accounts-{SERVICE_NAME}` packages without any extra native
libraries.

## How to Add All These to Your Existing Project

If you want to learn more to integrate all these features to your existing RN and Meteor projects
step-by-step;

- First, install `react-native-meteor-polyfills`in both Meteor and RN projects.

```bash
# For Meteor Project
meteor npm install react-native-meteor-polyfills--save
```

```bash
# For React Native Project
yarn add react-native-meteor-polyfills
# or
npm install react-native-meteor-polyfills--save
```

- Install `meteor-client-bundler` in your RN project

```
//For React Native Project
yarn add meteor-client-bundler --dev
//or
npm install meteor-client-bundler --save-dev
```

- Add `meteor-client.config.json` ;

```jsonc
{
  "runtime": {
    // These variables should be pointed to your Meteor server.
    "DDP_DEFAULT_CONNECTION_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
    "ROOT_URL": "http://localhost:3000"
  },
  "externalNpmPackages": [
    "react" // Use `react` from `node_modules`
  ],
  "generateNodeModules": true //Generate for `meteor/PACKAGE_NAME`
}
```

- Add `postinstall` to your `package.json` of your RN project, because generated `meteor-client.js`
  and other stub modules might be deleted. This script will restore them after each `node_modules`
  install.

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "meteor-client bundle -s {PATH_OF_METEOR_PROJECT}"
    // ...
  }
}
```

- Finally, run this script to generate those modules.
- After that do not forget to include `react-native-meteor-polyfills/client` and `meteor-client` in
  the top of React Native entry file `App.jsx` or `index.*.js` etc.

```js
import 'meteor-client'
import 'react-native-meteor-polyfills'
```

If you never used Meteor with React before, check out Meteor's official documentation for
`react-meteor-data` package, and OAuth packages.

And, YOUR NEW STACK IS READY TO RUN!

## Optional: Facebook, Twitter and Google Login Support

- If you want to make `Meteor.loginWith` work with React Native, you have to add custom URI scheme
  to your React Native project.
- Then, tell Meteor what your URI scheme is;

```js
import { setApplicationPrefix } from 'react-native-meteor-polyfills/server'

setApplicationPrefix('myURIscheme')
```
