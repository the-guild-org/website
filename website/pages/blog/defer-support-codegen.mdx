Optimization is crucial for the good performance of GraphQL applications, which can grow in
complexity and size. The `@defer` directive in GraphQL is a feature that allows fragment fields to
be resolved separately from the rest of the query. This can be useful when dealing with large
queries or slow-to-resolve fields.

And now, we have some exciting news to share: support for `@defer` is available in GraphQL Code
Generator! ðŸ¥³

You can start using GraphQL Code Generator to generate code for queries that include deferred
fragments, and the generated code will automatically include support for the `@defer` directive.

Let's take a closer look at how the directive works and how you can use it in your GraphQL
applications.

## How Does `@defer` Work?

When a query includes a deferred fragment field, the server will return a partial response with the
non-deferred fields first, followed by the remaining fields once they have been resolved.

For example, consider the following query:

```graphql
query GetUser($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    ...OrdersFragment @defer
  }
}

fragment OrdersFragment on User {
  orders {
    id
    total
  }
}
```

Let's say you have a query that fetches information about a user, but the `orders` field takes more
time to resolve. You can use the `@defer` directive to first return a partial response with the `id`
and `name` and then later return the `orders` field. This can improve the performance of your
application by reducing the amount of time it takes to load initial data.

## Using `@defer` with GraphQL Codegen

Once you update the GraphQL Code Generator to the latest version and start using the `@defer`
directive in your queries, the generated code will automatically include support for the directive.
Below, we're going to see an example of usage.

As the `@defer` directive
[is now supported in Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/defer/), we're going
explore how it works with Apollo Client. You need to use Apollo Client version 3.7.0 or higher for
the defer support to work.

_Note: you could also use the `@defer` directive with other GraphQL clients, such as
[URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/) â€” the example usage in Hive with URQL is
described below._

Here's an example `codegen.ts` config:

```jsx
// condegen.ts
import { type CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli'

const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: '<PATH_TO_YOUR_SCHEMA>',
  documents: ['src/**/*.tsx'],
  generates: {
    './gql/': {
      preset: 'client'
    }
  },
  hooks: { afterAllFileWrite: ['prettier --write'] }
}

export default config
```

Let's consider the same example with `user` and `orders`. Once you declare a fragment and a query in
your application, you can run the codegen, and it will have the information about deferred fields.

```jsx
// src/index.tsx
import { graphql } from './gql'

const OrdersFragment = graphql(`
  fragment OrdersFragment on User {
    orders {
      id
      total
    }
  }
`)

const GetUserQuery = graphql(`
  query GetUser($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      id
      name
      ...OrdersFragment @defer
    }
  }
`)
```

The generated type for `GetUserQuery` will have information that the fragment is _incremental,_
meaning it may not be available right away.

```tsx
// gql/graphql.ts

export type GetUserQuery = { __typename?: 'Query'; id: string; name: string } & ({
  __typename?: 'Query'
} & {
  ' $fragmentRefs'?: { OrdersFragment: Incremental<OrdersFragment> }
})
```

Apart from generating code that includes support for the `@defer` directive, the Codegen also
exports a utility function called `isFragmentReady`. This function can be used to determine whether
the data for a deferred fragment field has been resolved or not. The `isFragmentReady` function
takes three arguments: the query document, the fragment definition, and the data returned by the
query. You can use it to conditionally render components based on whether the data for a deferred
fragment is available, as shown in the example below:

```jsx
// index.tsx
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

import { useFragment, graphql, FragmentType, isFragmentReady } from './gql';

const OrdersFragment = graphql(`...`)

const GetUserQuery = graphql(`...`);

const OrdersList = (props: { data: FragmentType<typeof OrdersFragment> }) => {
  const data = useFragment(OrdersFragment, props.data);
  return (
    // render orders list
  )
};

function App() {
  const { data } = useQuery(GetUserQuery);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {data && (
        <>
          <span>Name: {data.name}</span>
          <span>Id: {data.name}</span>
          {isFragmentReady(GetUserQuery, OrdersFragment, data)
						&& <OrdersList data={data} />}
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

With the above code, the `orders` field is rendered only if it's available in the data object.

### Example with GraphQL Yoga and Apollo Client

If you want to see the `@defer` directive in action, you can check out
[the example in the GraphQL Code Generator repository](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/tree/master/examples/react/apollo-client-defer).

### How Does It Compare with Relay?

Relay allows for incremental delivery of data from the server to the client without an extra logic
on the client because it uses Suspense. It enables the client to render parts of the UI as soon as
the corresponding data is available.

The same can be achieved in other GraphQL clients with the `@defer` directive and the
`isFragmentReady` utility function.

As the Suspense usage requires deep integration with a GraphQL client code, the GraphQL Code
Generator does not support it out-of-the-box. We are looking forward to collaborate with the
maintainers of clients like Apollo Client and Urql, and go for a more generic suspense-backed
implementation in the future.

## Example Usage in GraphQL Hive

To evaluate the codegen support for the `@defer` directive, we integrated it into the GraphQL Hive
application. GraphQL Hive is a schema registry for GraphQL.

> With Hive you manage and collaborate on all your GraphQL schemas and GraphQL workflows, regardless
> of the underlying strategy, engine or framework you're using: this includes Schema Stitching
> (opens in a new tab), [Apollo Federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation), or just
> a traditional monolith approach.

The Hive application uses [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/) as its GraphQL
client, which supports the `@defer` directive starting from version 4.0.0.

In Hive, the operations page displays all server-executed operations, providing valuable insights
into operation performance, end-user consumption, and operation success rates.

Given the substantial amount of data to be loaded, we decided to apply the `@defer` directive to the
operation stats query fragments:

```graphql
query generalOperationsStats($selector: OperationsStatsSelectorInput!, $resolution: Int!) {
  operationsStats(selector: $selector) {
    ... on OperationsStats {
      # ...
    }
    ... on OperationsStats @defer {
      failuresOverTime(resolution: $resolution) {
        # ...
      }
      requestsOverTime(resolution: $resolution) {
        # ...
      }
      durationOverTime(resolution: $resolution) {
        # ...
      }
    }
    ... on OperationsStats @defer {
      clients {
        # ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can check out [a PR to Hive](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-hive/pull/2082) that adds
`@defer` in the operations page.

Throughout the process, we collaborated a bit with the URQL team to enhance URQL's `graphcache`
exchange, resulting in improved support for the `@defer` directive in the new version. You can check
out the relevant PRs:

- [Mark deferred, uncached results as partial](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3163)
- [Fix defer field state becoming sticky and affecting future fields](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3167)
- [Handle both variations of multipart/mixed preamble](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3172)

---

To summarize, the `@defer` directive in GraphQL is a feature that allows fragment fields in a query
to be resolved separately from the rest of the query. With support for `@defer` now available in
GraphQL Code Generator, you can easily add deferred resolution to your GraphQL applications and
optimize their performance. We hope that this new feature will help you build even more powerful and
performant GraphQL apps!
