Something about Apples and Oranges.

Some content that is being “borrowed” from the frameworks websites about Typescript vs Javascript, JSX vs HTML, native support for both and performance that is great on both.

Lots of outdated information about old versions of the frameworks.

## Conclusion

A generic, saying nothing sentence like “the choice between Angular 2 and React comes down to a style preference.”

By the way, just by chance we are also mentioning our “clickbait.js” product that let’s you work with Angular/React in the best possible way if you’ll pay us tons of money.
