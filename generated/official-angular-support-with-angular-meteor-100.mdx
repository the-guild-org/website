As announced earlier in this [blog post](http://info.meteor.com/blog/announcing-meteor-1.2), Angular is now officially supported in Meteor 1.2.

That means we’ve released the official `angular` [package](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/angular)! To start using the new package just go to your Meteor console and type: `meteor add angular`

From this point on, `urigo:angular` is deprecated in favor of the `angular` package.

We released [version 1.0.0](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor/releases/) of the `angular` package which supports Meteor 1.2 as well as older versions.

## The `angular` package let's you:

- Use Angular templates inside a Meteor project
- Connect Angular and Meteor data in the most seamless way across your stack
- Add any existing Angular app or 3rd party libraries to Meteor
- Angular wrappers for all of Meteor’s API
- Ability to use Blaze templates inside your angular-meteor project

We’ve also updated our [tutorials](http://angular-meteor.com/tutorials/angular1/bootstrapping) accordingly. On a personal note, this has been an amazing personal journey for me, working for this goal for about a year now. It’s only symbolic that we just passed the [1000 stars on Github](https://github.com/urigo/angular-meteor/) — and it’s just the start!

## What’s next?

- Moving to develop version 1.2.0 which will support the new build process introduced in Meteor 1.2
- Creating more resources on using **Angular with ES2015** which is supported by default from version 1.2

- Strengthening the **collaboration with the Angular team,** releasing an improved version of the **Angular 2.0 Meteor** integration and update the [Angular 2.0 Meteor tutorial](http://angular-meteor.com/tutorials/angular2/bootstrapping)

- **Ionic Framework** documentation — many of our users use angular-meteor with the Ionic Framework. Ionic [just added an official release to Meteor](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/pull/3133) and we will release two blog posts and a tutorial about how to use that in the best way.

- Code improvements by the notes of an internal **code review by Sashko**

- Like always, the roadmap will be motivated by our amazing growing community
