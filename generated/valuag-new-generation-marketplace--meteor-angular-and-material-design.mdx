We’re proud of announcing the first version of ValuAg. As you can see the landing page on ValuAg Web Site, it is a marketplace for buyers and farmers who cares GMO-free and organic food.

In terms of technology, ValuAg is built on latest technologies. Meteor, Angular, Progressive Web Application approach, Google’s Material Design, ElasticSearch and great 3rd party services such as Twilio, SendGrid, Firebase and Crisp.

# Why there is no extra mobile app?

As I described above we used the new generation web technologies, so a Progressive Web Application can be installed in the similar way with a native mobile application, receive push notifications, work offline thanks to Service Workers.
Using Angular’s Flex-Layout and Material libraries, we could create a mobile-first web application that user would nearly have same experience with a native mobile application.

You don’t need seperate development processes for each platform such as dealing with Xcode for iOS and Android Studio for Android.

Only one development process gives you an application that runs almost all platforms on a major browser.

# Why Meteor?

Meteor is a new generation framework that has an oplog driver for MongoDB which provides you real-time data transfer between your application server and the database, and also Meteor uses WebSockets which creates a real-time connection between your application server and client which is browser. All these provides you three way data binding between the database and the client. Angular’s bi-directional data flow and RxJS Observables can have a tight integration with Meteor.

Meteor aims zero-configuration for developers, so you can only focus on your development, which is ready-to-use initially on Meteor. Otherwise, you would have to deal with the integration of different libraries to create an architecture from scratch.

That’s why, Meteor fits very well the requirements of software-based products, which belongs to startups like ValuAg.

# Why Angular?

Angular is a complete framework that has Model-View-Controller approach and stands on TypeScript which is a superset of JavaScript. Angular has nearly everything you will need to initiate your development. Like Meteor, the development team don’t have to find out the ways for the integration of different libraries, because Angular already gives you TypeScript, RxJS and other stuff inside.

Thanks to Meteor and RxJS; `meteor-rxjs`, you don’t have to use an extra state management libraries such as Flux and Redux.

# Why Material?

Material Design is not another framework like Bootstrap, but just a set of design specifications. These specifications are already used on Android. It makes life easier for a developer who are not an actual designer like me.

Then we can easily focus on the development of features without considering about design.

# Why ElasticSearch?

The short answer is speed. ElasticSearch is very good at handling large datas. ValuAg uses ElasticSearch to handle big DBA, Certifications, Cuisine, EDI, PLU and Vegetable Planting Calendar data.

# What is next?

We, ValuAg Team, are thinking of new features on blockchain, and quick rewriting of ValuAg Web Application with Stencil and Firebase. However, we will try these technologies on our ICO Website. This is the topic of another blog post. Stay tuned!
