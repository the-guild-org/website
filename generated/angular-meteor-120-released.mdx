We are happy to announce the release of the new angular 1.2.0 package, which takes advantage of the new build process introduced in Meteor 1.2 to make Angular developers feel even more comfortable and productive.

The main difference between older versions is that now, we use Angular to process regular `HTML` and `JS` files instead of `.ng.html` and `.ng.js.`

We worked hard to make migrating an existing Angular app to Meteor easier. You can migrate by simply moving your entire existing project into Meteor, or also by using your own tools and connecting to a Meteor server, like [we demonstrated with Ionic](http://blog.ionic.io/ionic-and-meteor/).

For existing users, as the `HTML` parsing is now happening by the `angular` package, we should rename all `.ng.html` files to `.html` and remove the `blaze-html-templates` package to reduce load time on the client.

Also, the new `angular` package processes `JS` files with Babel for `Ecmascript 2015` support and `ng-annotate` out of the box.

It also adds the `decorators` syntax from Babel so it will be easier to use the [`pbastowski:angular2-now`](https://github.com/pbastowski/angular2-now/) package. This lets you write Angular 2.0 syntax in your Angular 1.x application, which we recommend as a best practice.

That means we should rename all `.ng.js` files to `.js` and remove the default `ecmascript` Meteor core package from our projects.

The new package also uses the Meteor 1.2 caching compilers to make the build process faster.

If you are using the `accounts-ui` package, we now have [`dotansimha:accounts-ui-angular`](https://github.com/dotansimha/accounts-ui-angular) package instead.

If you still want to continue using the old build process and combine Blaze and Angular templates, you can use the `angular-with-blaze` package instead of the \`angular\` package and keep using the same `ng.html` and `ng.js` file extensions and the [`urigo:angular-blaze-template`](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-blaze-template) package to include Blaze templates inside your Angular templates.

Going forward to version 1.3, we will start changing our API to be directed into the best practices we’ve recommended:

- Making the data API as similar as possible to the current and the future native Meteor API
- Removing the `autobind` feature to get better performance out of the box

To get ready, you can start using your `$meteor` [services](http://angular-meteor.com/api/meteorCollection) without `autobind` (sending `false` to that parameter).

Thanks for all the help we got from the community on this release!
