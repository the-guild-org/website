[GraphQL Code Generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/) is here for ~5 years, and it's improving developer exprience for many developers (>3M downloads a month on NPM!)

We recently decided to revisit and improve some parts of codegen, and we're happy to announce that we're releasing a new version of the tool (`v2`)!

This release is all about improving the reliability and readability of the generated code, and adding new features (and a new plugin!).

### Why `v2`?

We are currently working on adding ESM support for all [The Guild](http://the-guild.dev/) tools.

In Codegen, we are not there yet ([you can track the progress here](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/pull/6102), because we need to make sure that plugins, presets, schemas and documents are still being loaded correctly.
