Now that Angular is a [first class citizen in Meteor](https://blog.meteor.com/official-angular-support-with-angular-meteor-1-0-0-784f0cd7094a#.smxto0ghf), you can use all of its vast libraries, giving you full access to the Angular ecosystem.

Also, [Ionic recently added official support for Meteor’s packaging system](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/pull/3133), and now their package is available on [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/driftyco/ionic).

In this tutorial, we will build a WhatsApp clone using Meteor, Angular, and the Ionic Framework for CSS and mobile components. I’ve also released a [clone of this tutorial on the Ionic Blog](http://blog.ionic.io/ionic-and-meteor) that uses the Ionic CLI instead of the Meteor build system.

It’s a good resource for people who wants to use Meteor for their backend and Meteor’s client side libraries in a separate front end application, also a good migration strategy.

If you are using Blaze, you can still use Ionic’s CSS libraries or the [Meteoric package](https://atmospherejs.com/meteoric/ionic).
