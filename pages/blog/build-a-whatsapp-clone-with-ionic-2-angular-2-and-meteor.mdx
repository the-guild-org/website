_A version of this post was originally published on the [Ionic Blog](http://blog.ionic.io/build-a-whatsapp-clone-with-ionic-2-angular-2-and-meteor/)._

Now, a year has passed and a lot has happened: Angular 2.0 is now stable, including astonishing amount of new features for the platform. Ionic 2.0 entered RC stage and is very close to being final. Finally, Meteor [reached version 1.4.2](http://info.meteor.com/blog/announcing-meteor-1.4.2), with many improvements the community asked for (fast build times, full npm and yarn support, Node 4.6.1 and MongoDB 3 by default, etc..).

## New Ionic/Meteor Whatsapp Tutorials

Today, I’m happy to announce we are releasing two new versions of the Ionic/Meteor Whatsapp tutorial, this time with Angular 2.0 and Ionic 2.0, one using the **Ionic CLI** and one using the **Meteor CLI.**

In these tutorials, we’ll create a full WhatsApp clone using Angular 2 and Ionic 2. We’ll use Meteor’s realtime collections for the chat and Meteor’s simple Authentication packages for SMS-based authentication.

It’s great to see the power of these two solutions working together, keeping the platforms up-to-date with the latest improvements in the Javascript ecosystem!

## Angular2-Meteor

By the way, if you noticed that the [Angular-Meteor.com](https://angular-meteor.com/) website is much faster, it’s because we’ve completely re-written it using Angular 2 and universal rendering to generate it as a static website. On top of that, more features are coming to Angular2-Meteor very soon, including lazy loading of modules and support for the AOT compiler.

If you’re thinking about migrating from Blaze to Angular2, or using them side by side, check out our [migration tutorial here](https://angular-meteor.com/tutorials/migration/angular2/introduction).
