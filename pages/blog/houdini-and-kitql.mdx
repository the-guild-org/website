## Motivations

SvelteKit is an excellent alternative to all popular frameworks and simplifies the creation of "WebApp" _(put what you want behind this term ^^)_. Houdini and KitQL were created to manage GraphQL in this environment and use _(and abuse!)_ the new way of programming as much as possible.

A few months back, we had the chance to meet and decided to have a deeper look at the pros&cons of Houdini and KitQL approaches. From a high-level perspective:

#### General

- We were not satisfied by Apollo or URQL client for svelte

#### For Houdini

- A simple and effective normalized cache
- A way to augment operations (Pagination / List)
- Optimistic UI / Partial
- Client scalar
- Fragment masking

#### For KitQL

- Stores
- Debugging widget
- Making us of existing tools (Yoga / Envelop / Modules / Scalars / CodeGen / eslint / ...)

## How it looks like to use GraphQL in SvelteKit?

Doing a query that will manage SSR or CSR without thinking about anything:

```html
<script context="module" lang="ts">
  export async function load(loadInput: LoadInput) {
    await GQL_AllItems.queryLoad(loadInput, { variables: { completed: true } })
  }
</script>

{#each $GQL_AllItems.data.items as item} {item.title} {/each}
```

Extend the example with a loadmore button

```
<script lang="ts">
    function loadMore() {
        await GQL_AllItems.loadMore()
    }
</script>

{#each $GQL_AllItems.data.items as item}
    {item.title}
{/each}
<button on:click={loadMore}>Load More</button>
```
