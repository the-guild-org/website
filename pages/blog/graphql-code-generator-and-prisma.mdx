Prisma offers an easy solution for working with sqlite, and is amazingly simple to understand.

But, when using it with the GraphQL code generator, it could cause problems with conflicting types.

# How do we fix this?

Well, the code generator, has an option called mappers.

Using a mapper gives you the option to map one type to another. (for exapmle, mapping the prisma model to the corresponding GraphQL type.)

## Using mappers

Mappers are actually really easy to use, all you need to do is add them to your codegen.yml!

For exapmle, lets say I have a Prisma model which is called User, and my GraphQL schema also uses a type User.

For my project to work with its database, it needs to use the Prisma model instead of the GraphQL one, so I should map my User model from prisma to my User type in GraphQL.
Like this:

```yaml
schema: http://localhost:3000/graphql
documents: ./src/graphql/*.graphql
generates:
  graphql/generated.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript-operations
      - typescript-react-apollo
  config:
    mappers:
      User: .prisma/client#User as UserModel
```

Under the Mappers, you can see we take the User type, and set it to be using the exported type automatically created by Prisma.
We set it to be named UserModel, so it won't conflict with the GraphQL definition of the User type.

## what now?

Now, if you run `yarn run generate` or `npm run generate`, it will update the genereated file to work with your Prisma model.

Now everything should work currectly.
