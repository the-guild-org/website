Today we are incredibly excited to share with you the new GraphQL Yoga! This release was made possible with your contributions, issues, and feedback.

The Guild took over the development of GraphQL Yoga in early 2021, and with the growing community of tools in the GraphQL space, most recently [Envelop](https://envelop.dev/), we were able to rewrite GraphQL Yoga 2.0 from scratch with easy setup, performance, and developer experience at the core.

GraphQL Yoga continues to boast a "convention over configuration" approach and the freedom to use your favorite libraries, from HTTP to schema-building.

No longer are you required to install dozens of dependencies to get features such as Subscriptions, File Uploads, CORS, Error Masking, and more.

Building a GraphQL Yoga server requires a single import and only a few lines of code to start serving an API. And you also get GraphiQL for making development even easier.

```jsx
// 1. Import GraphQL Yoga
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

// 2. Create your server
const server = createServer({
  schema: {
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        hello: () => 'Hello Hello Hello'
      }
    }
  }
})

// 3. Serve the API and GraphiQL
server.start()
```

## The Yoga v2 experience

### Your stack and habits

The main goal of Yoga v2 is to **allow you to leverage all the GraphQL ecosystem** by being compatible with most of the existing schema-design, HTTP server libraries, and deployment environments.

Built on top of a **modular and extendable GraphQL Server**, Yoga v2 allows you to use your preferred schema design approach and HTTP server library.

For example, Yoga v2 is fully compatible with Express and Nexus, with no additional packages:

```tsx
import express from 'express'
import { makeSchema, queryType } from 'nexus'
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

const Query = queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.string('hello', { resolve: () => 'hello world!' })
  }
})
const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [Query]
})

const graphQLServer = createServer({ schema })

const app = express()

// Bind GraphQL Yoga to the `/graphql` endpoint
// Here it takes the request and response objects and handles them internally
app.use('/graphql', graphQLServer.requestListener)

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

The same applies to **GraphQL Tools, Pothos, Nexus, TypeGraphQL, SDL first schema-design approaches, `graphql-js`, Apollo Tools, Fastify, Koa, Next.js SvelteKit, and Deno**.

<br />

Beyond the compatibility of schema-design and HTTP server libraries, Yoga v2 makes **deploying a GraphQL API to any environment seamless**.

Here, a GraphQL API built with GraphQL Modules, deployed on Cloudflare Workers:

```tsx
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/common'

import { createApplication } from 'graphql-modules'
import { helloWorldModule } from './helloWorld'

const application = createApplication({
  modules: [helloWorldModule]
})

const server = createServer({ schema: application.schema })

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event: FetchEvent) => {
  event.respondWith(server.handleRequest(event.request))
})
```

Finally, Yoga v2 fits seamlessly in your GraphQL workflow and back-end ecosystem (Apollo Federation Gateway or Apollo Federation Service).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Productivity at your fingertips

**Batteries-included**

Yoga v2 comes with **sensible defaults to make development faster**, all with **complete TypeScript support**.

**Features common to modern GraphQL APIs** such as File-uploads, Subscriptions support, advanced error handling, or CORS **comes built-in with Yoga**:

```tsx
import { createServer, GraphQLYogaError } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

// Provide your schema
const server = createServer({
  schema: {
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      # adding this custom scalar enables file upload support
      scalar Upload

      type Query {
        hello: String
      }

      type Subscription {
        countdown(from: Int!): Int!
      }

      type Mutation {
        readTextFile(file: Upload!): String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        hello: () => 'world'
      },
      Subscription: {
        countdown: {
          // This will return the value on every 1 sec until it reaches 0
          subscribe: async function* (_, { from }) {
            for (let i = from; i >= 0; i--) {
              await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
              yield { countdown: i }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      Mutation: {
        readTextFile: async (_, { file }: { file: File }) => {
          let textContent = null
          try {
            textContent = await file.text()
          } catch (e) {
            // return an error visible by the client
            throw new GraphQLYogaError(`Failed to parse file`)
          }
          return textContent
        }
      }
    }
  }
})

// We now serve a GraphQL API with Subscriptions (over SSE), CORS,
// and File uploads support!
server.start()
```

Yoga v2 also provides APIs to handle **logging, advanced Subscriptions** use-cases (over WS, Pub/Sub), Apollo **Federation Support**, [and more](https://www.graphql-yoga.com/docs/quick-start).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Easily extend your API with Envelop plugins**

GraphQL Yoga supports [Envelop](https://envelop.dev/) out of the box, which gives you greater control, and the ability to hook into the GraphQL execution phases.

Here, we are building a full-featured GraphQL API with validation cache, security rules, and tracing with only a few lines of code:

```tsx
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

import { useDepthLimit } from '@envelop/depth-limit'
import { useResponseCache } from '@envelop/response-cache'
import { useSentry } from '@envelop/sentry'

import { schema } from './schema'

const server = createServer({
  schema: {
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        hello: () => 'Hello Hello Hello'
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    useDepthLimit({
      // set up some security rules
      maxDepth: 10
    }),
    useResponseCache(), // speed up our server with a response cache
    useSentry() // report unexpected errors to sentry
  ]
})

// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

The Envelop Plugin currently [proposes more than 35+ plugins](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins) covering most of the standard GraphQL APIs features you need in production.

Ultimately, you can [develop custom Envelop plugins](https://www.envelop.dev/docs/plugins/custom-plugin) to create reusable behaviors that hook on to the GraphQL lifecycle.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Production-ready

GraphQL Yoga v2 has been built in production for production usage.

Built-in real-world conditions within our projects (ex: [GraphQL Mesh](https://graphql-mesh.com/)) and with some of [our clients](https://www.the-guild.dev/services), performance was highly prioritised.
The core of Yoga is as performant as possible, and we continuously keep track and improve it.

Also, the Yoga V2 repository runs performance checks on every commit and Pull Request, so we can always capture any performance regression.

We continue our effort of pushing GraphQL Yoga to more production environments with the imminent release of [Redwood 1.0](https://redwoodjs.com/) that will use Yoga 2.0 as the default GraphQL server.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### A standards-compliant GraphQL Server

In the same way, as TypeScript aims to stay aligned with ECMAScript, GraphQL Yoga is based on several official and recognized specs:

- [GraphQL-spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/), [GraphQL-over-HTTP](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http): guarantees your GraphQL API to work with all existing GraphQL clients (Apollo, Relay, URQL, and more).
- [GraphQL-Multipart-Request](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec): enables great File uploads support.
- [W3C Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/): we embrace the future of Node.js and provide the same developer experience on all platforms.

Yoga v2 also supports some experimental GraphQL features such as [`@defer` and `@stream`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/2839), allowing you to get a taste of the future of GraphQL (with compatible clients such as [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/comparison/#core-features)).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
