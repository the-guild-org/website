**We are super excited to introduce a new development tool by The Guild!**

We recently found noticed a gap in the development flow for GraphQL developers: it's very hard to maintain standards in GraphQL schema and GraphQL operations.

And due to the fact that GraphQL ecosystem is growing quickly, we decided to create a modern integration between GraphQL and ESLint, that supports all the modern needs of a GraphQL developer: [`graphql-eslint`](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-eslint).

> Special thanks to [ilyavolodin](https://github.com/ilyavolodin) for his work on a similar project. We've joined forces to bring a new exiting tool for you!

## What it does?

<Gfycat gifId={'actualterrificdog'} />

With `graphql-eslint` you can easily validate and lint your GraphQL schema, and your GraphQL operations, enforce code-style, best practices, and avoid runtime issues.

![GraphQL-ESLint](/blog-assets/graphql-eslint/1.png 'GraphQL ESLint in action')

It can run as a syntax validation tool (without GraphQL schema), or as a complete solution for validation your GraphQL operations (with a schema loaded).

`graphql-eslint` works on your `.graphql` files, but also on your code-files that uses `gql` (or, `graphql` template literal tag), or `/* GraphQL */` magic comments.

It fully integrated with VSCode for visualizing the reported issues, and allow you to customize the rules, and add custom rules easily.

## How does it work?

This package acts as a ESLint parser, and a plugin with rules.

The parser we wrote transforms the [GraphQL AST](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/language/) into [ESTree structure](https://github.com/estree/estree), so it allows you to travel the GraphQL AST tree easily.

If you wish to read more about [how it works, please refer to the docs directory in the repo](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-eslint/blob/master/docs/README.md).

## Writing your own rules

Since it's running as a real ESLint parser, [you can easiliy customize it and write your own rules](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-eslint/blob/master/docs/custom-rules.md), based on your project's needs and preferences.

If you are familiar with the GraphQL AST structure, you can write custom rules very quickly, since our solution comes with a wrapper that makes it easier to write and test new rules, and have full TypeScript support.

Need a new custom rule? Just create a file in your project, and travel the AST to make sure it matches your needs.

```ts
import { GraphQLESLintRule } from '@graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin';

const rule: GraphQLESLintRule = {
  create(context) {
    return {
      OperationDefinition(node) {
        if (node && (!node.name || node.name.value === '')) {
          context.report({
            node: node,
            message: `Oops, name is required on GraphQL operations!`,
          });
        }
      },
    };
  },
};
```

## Compared to similar tools

There are other solutions that offer GraphQL linting.

We decided to write a modern library that fits our clients' needs, intergrates with IDEs, and easily customizable by anyone.

- `apollographql/eslint-plugin-graphql` - offers a similar solution, by designed in a different architecture. But unfortunatly, it's not customizable and extendable, and doesn't work on some modern solution.
- `cjoudrey/graphql-schema-linter` - works as a standalone tool (without ESLint) and offers rules for linting GraphQL schemas only.
