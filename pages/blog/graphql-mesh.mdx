We are excited to announce [GraphQL Mesh](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh) — a powerful open source library enabling developers to leverage the power of GraphQL without requiring changes to the technologies your servers already use.

We’ve been using this tool to significantly improve our clients stacks — improving the areas that a classic GraphQL gateways would have left untouched

![Mesh SDK](/blog-assets/graphql-mesh/sdk.png 'Mesh SDK')

## The basics:

- GraphQL Mesh takes **any source schema** (openapi/Swagger, json-schema, SOAP, gRPC, SQL, Mongoose, GraphQL, Federated GraphQL, queue systems, and others) and let you query it as **GraphQL without changing the source service**
- Choose the fields you want, in the shape you want them
- Get full type-safety for remote APIs
- **Schema unification/Stitching for any source**
